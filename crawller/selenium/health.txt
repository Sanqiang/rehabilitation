Photo: Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images\nPRO: Pro players got us talking about an important issue\nIn August, National Football League (NFL) quarterback\u00a0Colin Kaepernick began refusing to stand for the national anthem. Many people spoke out against the San Francisco 49ers\u00a0player for his action. In the midst of a divisive election year, an important discussion about race, class and violence in this country was almost abandoned by the news media.\n\nThen, something surprising happened. Many in the sports world supported Kaepernick and his right to protest. Many did so even as they continued to stand, with their hands over their hearts, for \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d\u00a0\n\nGregg Popovich coaches the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s San Antonio Spurs. He said he absolutely understands why Kaepernick and other protestors are doing what they're doing. \"The important thing that Kaepernick and others have done is to keep it in the conversation,\" he said.\u00a0\n\nChip Kelly, Kaepernick\u2019s coach, said that his quarterback\u2019s decision was \u201chis right as a citizen.\u201d\n\nStanding On An Athlete's Stage\n\nKaepernick is not the first famous athlete to take a stand against racial inequality.\n\nAt a sports awards show in July, basketball players Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul took the stage together. They urged their fellow athletes to become more socially involved.\n\nTime and again, the sports world\u2019s best athletes have led by example. In 1967, professional boxer Muhammad Ali took a stand against the Vietnam War. In 1968, African-American runners Tommie Smith and John Carlos led the black power salutes, a political demonstration at the Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Mexico.\u00a0\n\nA half-century ago, the St. Louis Cardinals were one of the best teams in baseball, for a number of reasons. Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Gibson once said the Cardinals \u201cwere the rainbow coalition of baseball.\u201d Their roster not only included blacks and whites, but Latinos, too.\n\nIn 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. The next morning, Gibson, who is black, got into a heated conversation about racial equality with his catcher, Tim McCarver, who is white. Years later, McCarver wrote, \u201cBob and I reached a meeting of the minds that morning. That was the kind of talk we often had on the Cardinals.\u201d\n\nWe need that kind of direct, honest talk again.\n\nTrouble For Taking A Stand\n\nOf course, many sports stars in the 1960s were punished for taking a public stand. Smith and Carlos were stripped of their Olympic medals. Ali was banished from boxing for years for refusing to fight in the Vietnam War. It took the country years to acknowledge the courage and wisdom in the positions they took.\n\nPresident Barack Obama recently said that what Smith and Carlos did may have been controversial at the time, but it created opportunity for future generations.\n\nWe find ourselves at a similar crossroads today, and a growing number of athletes and coaches realize it. They have dared to hold a mirror up to the rest of us, urging us to do better as a nation. It is our loss if we refuse to listen.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Tim Wendel is the author of 11 books and is the writer in residence at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C.\nCON: This is no place to stage a protest\nAmericans of all economic classes and backgrounds have always been able to escape life\u2019s troubles by watching sports.\u00a0\n\nHowever, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick may change that.\u00a0\n\nHe is not the first athlete to mix politics and sports. At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, for example, medal-winning runners Tommie Smith and John Carlos were expelled for holding up black-gloved fists during the the national anthem.\n\nKaepernick is not even the only one\u00a0to make a political statement at a sporting event this year. In July, Minnesota Lynx players, part of the Women\u2019s National Basketball Association, wore Black Lives Matter T-shirts before a game. Black Lives Matter is an activist-led movement that protests against discriminatory practices toward black people by police and the courts. Four off-duty police officers providing security for the event walked off the job, staging their own protest.\n\nKaepernick's position is more high-profile, though, and his actions have sparked similar protests everywhere from high schools to professional leagues.\u00a0\n\nWhile some have voiced their support of Kaepernick, the general public may have a different view. NFL viewership is down this fall, and a recent poll found Kaepernick to be the most disliked NFL player.\n\nWhat Is Too Far?\n\nIn protest movements, it's common for protestors to try push things to the next level. If athletes can kneel during the national anthem, can they turn their back? Can they stand on a U.S. flag, or even burn it? At some point, school administrators, coaches, sports leagues, reporters and fans will have to think about this. They will have to decide when a protest goes too far.\n\nI do not question someone\u2019s First Amendment right to express their views, but I do question the venue these athletes have chosen. I also question their target. By protesting the national anthem, they are protesting America.\n\nIt is true that America has at times failed to live up to its ideals, but it has also made progress.\n\nThere have been some tragic events lately involving black men and the police. America did not cause these tragedies, though. They occurred in Charlotte, North Carolina, Tulsa, Oklahoma, New York City and other places. They are local incidents involving local people.\n\nSome police officers may have failed the African-American community, but most Americans are outraged when injustices occur. They want those responsible to be held accountable.\n\nStart A Charity Or Nonprofit\n\nIf famous athletes want to make a difference, there are better ways than protesting the national anthem.\n\nBoth Kaepernick and the 49ers recently announced they will be donating to charities focusing on racial issues. Shouldn\u2019t that have been their initial response?\n\nIf some athletes continue to kneel during the national anthem, those of us who still take pride in America should stand a little taller.

He feels that African-Americans are oppressed, or kept down, by the American government.\n\nMany people were angry that Kaepernick would not stand for the anthem.

Kaepernick was trying to start a discussion about race and violence in this country.\n\nHowever, something surprising happened. Many in the sports world supported Kaepernick.

Smith and Carlos lost their medals. Ali was banished from boxing for years.

Photo: Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images\nPRO: Protests push all of us to face dilemma of racial injustice\n\nWhen NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick began refusing to stand for the national anthem, many media pundits and others chastised him for it. An important discussion about race, class and violence in this country nearly fell into the news-cycle churn of a divisive election year.\n\nBut then something surprising took place. Many in the sports world closed ranks around Kaepernick and supported his right to protest even as they continued to stand, many with hands over their hearts, for \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d\n\nSan Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said, \u201cI absolutely understand why they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re doing, and I respect their courage for what they\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nPopovich, who served in the Air Force and is the new coach of the U.S. men\u2019s national basketball team, added that, \u201cThe important thing that Kaepernick and others have done is to keep it in the conversation. \u2026 With our 24/7 news, things seem to drift.\u201d\n\nChip Kelly, Kaepernick\u2019s coach, said that his quarterback\u2019s decision was \u201chis right as a citizen.\u201d\n\nKaepernick, however, certainly isn\u2019t the first prominent athlete to use his stage to take a stand against racial inequality.\n\nAt July\u2019s ESPY Awards, basketball players Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul took the stage to urge their fellow athletes to become socially more involved. Serena Williams, Michael Irvin and others soon raised their voices, too.\n\nFrom the black power salutes by Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the Mexico City Olympics to Muhammad Ali\u2019s stand against the Vietnam War, time and again, the sports world\u2019s best have led by example.\n\n\u201cGenerations ago, legends like Jesse Owens, Jackie Robinson \u2026 set a model for what athletes should stand for,\u201d Paul told the audience at the ESPYs. \u201cSo we choose to follow in their footsteps.\u201d\n\nA half-century ago, the St. Louis Cardinals were one of the best teams in baseball for a number of important reasons. Their roster not only included blacks and white but Latino stars, too. Long before Jesse Jackson coined the phrase, the Cardinals \u201cwere the rainbow coalition of baseball,\u201d as Bob Gibson once said.\n\nThe morning after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assassination in 1968, Gibson got into a heated conversation with his catcher, Tim McCarver. The future Hall of Fame pitcher told McCarver that he couldn\u2019t possibly comprehend what it was like to be a black person and that it was impossible for whites, no matter how well intentioned, to totally overcome prejudice.\n\nTo his credit, McCarver, who had grown up in Memphis, Tenn., where King had been struck down, refused to let the conversation end there. In doing so, McCarver found himself in \u201cthe unfamiliar position of arguing that the races were equal and that we were all the same.\u201d\n\nYears later, McCarver wrote that \u201cBob and I reached a meeting of the minds that morning. That was the kind of talk we often had on the Cardinals.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s the kind of frank, honest talk we need again.\n\nOf course, many sports stars in the 1960s were criticized and worse for taking a public stand.\n\nSmith and Carlos were stripped of their medals. Ali was banished for years from boxing for refusing to enter the draft. It took the country years to acknowledge the courage and even the wisdom in the positions they took.\n\n\u201cTheir powerful silent protest in the 1968 Games was controversial,\u201d President Barack Obama recently said of Smith and Carlos, \u201cbut it woke folks up and created greater opportunity for those that followed.\u201d\n\nWe find ourselves at a similar crossroads today, and a growing number of athletes and coaches realize it. They have dared to hold a mirror up to the rest of us, urging us to do better as a nation.

At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, for example, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, the 200-meter race gold and bronze winners, were expelled after holding up black-gloved fists at their award presentation during the playing of the national anthem.\n\nNor has Kaepernick been the only one to make a political statement at a sporting event this year. In July, Minnesota Lynx players, part of the Women\u2019s National Basketball Association, wore Black Lives Matter T-shirts during warm-ups before a game with the Dallas Wings. Four off-duty officers providing security for the event walked off the job, expressing their own type of protest.\n\nBut Kaepernick\u2019s high-profile visibility ignited the protest echo chamber, from high schools to professional athletes.\n\nWhile some have voiced their support for the protests, the general public may have a different view.\n\nEarly reports indicate that NFL viewership is down this fall. And ESPN recently reported on a poll finding Kaepernick the most disliked player in the NFL.\n\nIt\u2019s common in protest movements for some to try and push things to the next level.\n\nIf athletes can kneel during the playing of the national anthem, can they turn their back?

While the jury is still out on some of those incidents, some appear to have been real travesties of justice.\n\nBut America didn\u2019t cause these tragedies. They occurred in Charlotte, N.C., Tulsa, Okla., New York City and other places. They are local incidents with local actors, even if they have national ramifications.\n\nSome police officers \u2014 and perhaps their departments and elected officials \u2014 may have failed the African-American community, but most Americans are outraged when injustices occur and want those proven to have overreacted or committed illegal acts to be held accountable.\n\nIf high-profile athletes want to make a difference, there are better and more meaningful responses than dissing the national anthem and turning a sporting event into a national soapbox.\n\nIf some want to express their concerns about current events, they should tell their publicists they are open for speaking engagements \u2014 off the field or court. They will have lots of opportunities \u2014 and media coverage.\n\nIn addition, if those whose athletic talents have made them wealthy want to have an impact, they should set up a nonprofit foundation or program that actually addresses specific problems.

Soon after,\u00a0 I learned that some lawmakers wanted to build a museum of African-American history.\n\nI have loved history since I was a boy. It started when I was so young. We celebrated Negro History Week. It is now called Black History Month. My teachers asked us to cut out pictures in magazines and newspapers of famous African-Americans, like civil rights activist Rosa Parks and scientist and inventor George Washington Carver. Growing up in Alabama, I knew the power of history.\n\nI tried to get lawmakers to vote to build the museum for 15 years.\n\nA Victory For Humankind\n\nI don't give up on my dreams. I always see hope in everything. If the museum bill passed, I would win a victory for humankind.\n\nSo I continued to introduce the bill in every session of Congress. Eventually, lawmakers voted for it. It was signed into law in 2003 by President George W. Bush.\n\nPeople have long dreamed about building an African-American museum. On May 24, 1916, the group held a meeting in Washington, D.C. The group was called the National Memorial Association.Their museum would celebrate African-Americans in many areas of life.\n\nSome of them were soldiers, artists, writers, inventors and scientists. On Sept. 24, the National Museum of African American History and Culture will finally open in Washington. It is exactly 100 years and four months after that meeting.\n\nMillions Of African-American Men And Women Helped Build America\n\nMillions of black men and women built this country. They did it with hard work and suffering. They have fought in every war. They defended the right to vote, although they were not allowed to vote. They did this because they believed in something greater than themselves. That is why this museum deserves to be in our country's capital.\n\nPeople do not know much about African-American history.\n\nSome people think there aren't problems between races in America. Why? It is because we do not talk about it. We do not admit that black people are angry about how they are treated.\n\nWe Are All One\n\nWe can not avoid the truth. We are one people, one family, the American family. We all live in one house, the American house, the world house. We are more alike than we are different. That is why this museum can heal us.\n\nLet the truth speak to our hearts and minds. Let this museum show the complete truth. Do not sweep the uncomfortable parts into some dark corner or under a rug.\n\nThe African-American story is one of the most inspiring stories in human history. African Americans were not treated equally. Yet they gave their lives for America. Martin Luther King Jr. said that in the future, history books will say, there lived a great people, a black people. And they gave meaning and dignity to the world.\n\nDemocratic Representative John Lewis of Georgia is a civil rights leader. He has fought for the equal treatment of African-Americans in America. In June, he led a lawmaker protest over gun laws. He also has co-written books about civil rights.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "1000L": "Opinion: New museum celebrates, honors African-American history\nBy Rep.

Two years later, Democratic Representative Mickey Leland of Texas asked me to co-sponsor it with him.\n\nI have loved history ever since I was a boy. It started when I was so young.

I was on board with the museum idea and Mickey did not have to ask me twice.\n\nUnfortunately, he died less than a year later. I introduced the museum bill in every session of Congress for 15 years.\n\nGiving Up Wasn't An Option\n\nGiving up on dreams is not an option for me. Hope in the face of challenge is the only alternative I see. I knew that if I was persistent and consistent, I would at least play my role well in this effort, and at most, I could win a victory for humanity.\n\nSo I continued to introduce the legislation in every session of Congress and worked to find a way to get the bill through. Eventually, it passed the House and Senate and was signed into law in 2003 by President George W. Bush. The idea began exactly 100 years ago by a group of people who helped black Civil War veterans.\n\nOn May 24, 1916, the National Memorial Association held a meeting in Washington, D.C. Its members discussed creating \"a beautiful building\" in Washington. They wanted to celebrate the contributions of African-Americans in the military, art, literature, invention, science, industry and other areas of life. On this Sept. 24, exactly 100 years and four months later, the National Museum of African American History and Culture will finally open in Washington. It will be placed at the foot of the Washington Monument, which honors our country's first president.\n\nAfrican-American Men And Women Helped Build America\n\nMillions of black men and women built this country through hard labor, sacrifice and suffering. They built it through creativity and ingenuity, willpower and faith. They have fought in every war and defended democracy, although they could not vote. They did this because they believed in something greater than themselves. They had faith and an ability to make a way out of no way. That is why this museum deserves a prominent place among the memorials to the founders of this country.\n\nPeople know so little about African-American history.\n\nSome people think that race, for example, is no longer a problem in America. Why? Because we spent the last part of the 1900s burying any discussion of a racial divide and ignored the anger many black people feel. We believed our denial would somehow make the problem go away.\n\nBut the unrest in our society today demonstrates that avoiding the truth is impossible. Covering a wound without treating it first increases the danger of infection. The truth can lead to only one conclusion: We are one people, one family, the American family. We all live in one house, the American house, the world house. It will lead us to see that we are more alike than we are different, that we are not separate but we are one. That is why this museum can have a healing effect on our society.\n\nWe Can't Ignore The \"Uncomfortable Parts\"\n\nLet the truth speak to our hearts and minds. Let this museum share the complete truth, without sweeping the uncomfortable parts into some dark corner or under a rug.\n\nUltimately the African-American story is a collection of some of the most inspiring stories in human history. It is the story of those who were denied equal rights, but who laid down their lives in every generation to redeem the soul of America. \"When the history books are written in future generations,\" Martin Luther King Jr. once said, \"the historians will have to pause and say, 'There lived a great people \u2013 a black people \u2013 who injected new meaning and dignity into the veins of civilization.'\"\n\nDemocratic Representative John Lewis of Georgia was a civil rights leader and was beaten in 1965 protesting segregation.\u00a0 In June, he led a lawmaker sit-in on the House floor over gun control.

It started when I was so young. We celebrated Negro History Week. It is now called Black History Month. My teachers asked us to find pictures of famous African Americans. One of them was Rosa Parks. She refused to give up her seat on a bus for a white person in Montgomery, Alabama. Another was George Washington Carver. He was born a slave and became a famous inventor. I grew up in Alabama. I knew the power of history.\n\nI dreamed of an African-American museum. I don't give up on my dreams. The museum would be a great gift to the world.\n\nNew Museum Is An Old Idea\n\nEvery year, I tried to get lawmakers to vote for it. After 15 years of trying, they agreed. This was in 2003. But the idea of building the museum is actually very old.\n\nOn May 24, 1916, the National Memorial Association held a meeting in Washington, D.C. This group helped black Civil War soldiers. Its members wanted to start a museum to honor African-Americans. Black people did great things for our country throughout history.

Photo: AP Photo/Charles Dharapak\nI first learned there was an effort to establish a national museum dedicated to preserving African-American history and culture during my first term in Congress after being elected in 1986. My colleague Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, discovered that the most recent legislative efforts had run aground a few years earlier because of an attempt by Rep. Clarence Brown, R-Ohio, and Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, to take the project to Wilberforce, Ohio. Mickey resurrected the idea and asked me to co-sponsor it in 1988.\n\nI have loved history ever since I was a boy. It started when I was so young. To celebrate Carter G. Woodson's innovation \u2013 then called Negro History Week and now called Black History Month \u2013 my teachers would ask us to cut out pictures in magazines and newspapers of famous African-Americans, such as Rosa Parks and George Washington Carver. Growing up in Alabama near Tuskegee Institute, reading about Carver and Booker T. Washington, attending Fisk University later with its world-class art collection and Jubilee Singers who had sung for Queen Victoria, I knew the power of legacy. Mickey did not have to ask me twice. I was on board to push the museum bill through.\n\nUnfortunately, he was killed in a plane crash less than a year later. So the baton was passed to me. I introduced the museum bill in every session of Congress for 15 years. I got it through the House in 1994, but Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., mounted a filibuster against the bill. My Senate partners asked to meet in my office one day. They said, \"John, we have the votes to get this through the Senate, but we just don't have anything to trade Jesse.\" That push did not lead to passage, but I had gotten closer than I ever had before.\n\nGiving up on dreams is not an option for me. Optimism is essential to the philosophy and discipline of nonviolence, so hope in the face of challenge is the only alternative I see. I knew that if I was persistent and consistent, I would at least play my role well in this effort, but at most I could win a victory for humanity.\n\nSo I continued to introduce the legislation in every session of Congress and worked to find a way to get the bill through. Ultimately, I made a key alliance with Sen. Max Cleland , D-Georgia, Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kansas, and Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Oklahoma. The bill won passage in the House and Senate and was signed into law in 2003 by President George W. Bush. My final drive to the finish line was the completion of a dream first launched by visionary supporters of black Civil War veterans exactly 100 years ago.\n\nOn May 24, 1916, the National Memorial Association held a meeting in Washington, D.C., at 19th Street Baptist Church, a nearly 180-year-old congregation still in existence today. Its members discussed the creation of \"a beautiful building\" they hoped to establish on the Mall. Their goal was \"to commemorate the deeds American [N]egroes wrought for the perpetuation and advancement of the Nation,\" celebrating their contribution to America in \"military service, in art, literature, invention, science, industry\" and other areas of life. On this Sept. 24, exactly 100 years and four months later, the National Museum of African American History and Culture will finally open in Washington, prominently placed at the foot of the Washington Monument.\n\nMillions of black men and women built this country through hard labor, sacrifice and suffering, through creativity and ingenuity, sheer willpower and enduring faith. They have fought in every war and defended the principles of democracy knowing they would not share in the victory. They did this not because they anticipated any benefit, but because they believed in something greater than themselves. That faith in the unseen and their ability to make a way out of no way is a demonstration of the character it took to build this nation, and that is why this museum deserves a prominent space among the memorials to the founders of this country.\n\nPeople know so little about African-American history. We want to try to hide nearly 400 years of history from ourselves, as though it will somehow disappear if we never mention it. But all around us we see pockets of the past erupting before our very eyes.\n\nSome people thought that the hostility and angst around issues of race, for example, no longer existed in America, to the degree that they actually believed we were living in a post-racial society. Why? Because we spent the latter part of the 20th century burying any discussion of a racial divide and refusing to admit that antagonism was still festering beneath the surface in our society. We vilified people who suggested race could be a cause of conflict, believing our denial would somehow make the problem go away.\n\nBut the upheavals in our society today demonstrate that avoiding the truth is impossible. Covering a wound without treating it with medicine first only makes it fester and increases the danger of infection. Actually, it is confronting the truth that leads to liberation from our past. Yes, it may require an adjustment in our thinking, but in the final analysis the truth can lead to only one conclusion: We are one people, one family, the American family. We all live in one house, the American house, the world house. It will lead us to see the divine spark that resides in each and every one of us and is a part of the entire creation. It will lead us to see that we are more alike than we are different, that we are not separate, but we are one. That is why this museum can have a healing effect on our society.\n\n\"Beauty is truth, truth beauty. That is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"\n\nThose are some of my favorite words by John Keats, and they resonate so clearly in this case. Only the truth has the power to lead us to the beauty we seek in our democracy. Only then can we build a Beloved Community in America.\n\nOur Declaration of Independence declares each and every one of us has a divine legacy that nothing and no one can take away. So much of the American story is the legacy of our attempts to realize that truth through democracy, and almost all of our conflict has been founded in the foolhardy ambition to try to subvert that mission. Once we push the haze of myth away, we will see the truth of ourselves in each other. When we see ourselves in each other, then injustice and oppression are not so easily perpetrated.\n\nLet the truth speak to our hearts and minds. Let this museum share the complete, unvarnished truth, without whitewash or avoidance, without sweeping the discomforting parts in some dark corner or under a rug. Let the curators and directors create ingenious ways to expose ourselves to ourselves so we can light the way to a more inclusive, truly democratic society.\n\nUltimately the African-American story is a collection of some of the most inspiring stories in human history that demonstrate the invincible nature of every human spirit. It is the story of those who were denied equality but who laid down their lives in every generation to redeem the soul of America. \"When the history books are written in future generations,\" Dr. King once said, \"the historians will have to pause and say, 'There lived a great people \u2013 a black people \u2013 who injected new meaning and dignity into the veins of civilization.' \"\n\nRep.

Photo: Raymond Boyd/Getty Images\nIn Michigan, a school superintendent's apology has ignited another heated debate about a flag.\n\nThis time it's not the Confederate flag, though, but the original \"Betsy Ross\" flag.\u00a0Although historians are not sure whether Betsy Ross actually made the flag, her name is forever associated with it. Everyone recognizes the flag, the one with 13 stars on a blue background and 13 red and white stripes.\n\nIt was approved by the Continental Congress in 1777. There, the convention delegates adopted a resolution stating that \"the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.\"\n\nEra Of Slavery\n\nIn Michigan, however, the problem with the flag is not its origin.\n\nThe problem is whether the flag, since it's been adopted by some white supremacist groups and because it was flown during the era of slavery, should be considered a symbol of \"exclusion and hate.\" That's the concern of Forest Hills School Superintendent Dan Behm. He believes the flag is so offensive \"to some\" that it has no place at a high-school football game.\n\nThe controversy got rolling last weekend when Forest Hills High School played a game on the home field of Ottawa High School in Grand Rapids. Forest Hills is a predominately white school, while Ottawa High School is predominately black.\n\nFirst Flag And Donald Trump\n\nSome Forest Hills students were parading around not only with the first flag but also with a banner supporting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. They were also\u00a0chanting \"go green\" and \"go white,\" which are the school colors.\n\nThe combination offended, among others, Matthew Patulski, a white parent of two students enrolled in Grand Rapids public schools. Trump is known for his \"support of\u00a0racist ideologies,\" Patulski wrote in an open letter on his Facebook page. The \"Betsy Ross\" flag, he added, is \"a piece of history co-opted by white supremacists who see it as a symbol of a time in our nation's history when slavery was legal.\"\n\nAt first, Forest Hills's Behm said that the Forest Hills students were participating in a \"red, white and blue\" theme night. \"The theme for each game changes, but students have generally had the 'red, white and blue' theme each year around the September 11 anniversary.\"\n\nBy Tuesday, however, Behm apologized in an open letter, calling the display \"inappropriate.\"\n\nHostility And Confusion\n\n\"Parading our current United States flag in a manner that is inconsistent with proper etiquette is disrespectful to all who have served our nation,\" he wrote. \"And, to wave a historical version of our flag, that to some symbolizes exclusion and hate, injects hostility and confusion into an event where no one intended to do so. To our gracious hosts ... and to the student-athletes, coaches, officials and supporters of both teams, we are truly sorry.\"\n\nNobody, he said, is being punished for the incident.\n\nBehm's apology has elicited praise in some quarters but been slammed in others. \"This whole PC thing has gotten way out of hand,\" said one online commenter. \"Why is it acceptable to proudly wear a Black Lives Matter T-shirt, and not our country's flag?\"\n\nSupport For Free Speech\n\n\"All students across the country have the right to free speech,\" said another. \"Kids aren't allowed to hold a flag? ...What's next, will the school band not be allowed to play the national anthem? Can't hold a Trump sign? ...\"What's next?\"\n\nOthers suggested that if they had been holding a Hillary Clinton banner, everything would have been different.\n\nOn the other side, Grand Rapids school superintendent Teresa Weatherall Neal thanked Behm for his leadership, and his letter and apology.\n\n\"I cannot deny the hurt, disrespect and outrage that I and so many others in this community felt about these actions that took place in our backyard. ...This type of behavior should not and will not be tolerated in our stadium or schools \u2014 nor should it in any community across our state and nation.\"\n\nBriana Urena-Ravelo, a Grand Rapids resident and Black Lives Matter activist, explained to TV8 in Michigan why she thought the flag was offensive: \"What were the conditions for people of color when that flag was created? I was property. Other people were getting their land stolen,\" she said.\n\nTime To Retire First Flag?\n\nThe incident in Michigan\u00a0raises the question of whether America's first flag, along with the Confederate flag, is destined to become another point of controversy in the country.\u00a0For the general public, that would be a change.\n\nThe \"Betsy Ross\" flag is depicted on the Department of Veterans Affairs official shield.\n\nIt's routinely hauled out for Flag Day, and for other occasions. And yes, it's also been displayed from time to time by supporters of Donald Trump and by the Patriot movement, which includes some groups that promote white supremacist views.\n\nForest Hills Schools parent Patricia Gerondale, whose son brought the Trump flag to the game, said the visiting students never intended any harm or intimidation. \"It wasn't done to put anyone down or cause any negative feeling,\" she said, and carried \"no message behind it.\"\n\nBut it's apparent that for some, that's not the case. This, in turn, raises the question of whether white supremacist groups have the power to blemish symbols and icons simply by adopting them, to the point that they become offensive by association.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: Does first flag symbolize \"exclusion and hate,\" as some say?\nBy Fred Barbash, Washington Post\n09.19.16\n\nA replica \"Betsy Ross\" flag is posted on the side of the Betsy Ross House in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on August 27, 2016.

I was compelled to honor her request by the expression on her face \u2014 the look in her eyes \u2014 it was startling to me, a white man in his early 50s.

The picture, which has gone viral nationally, shows them grinning with immense pride while they display widely respected symbols of historical significance in our great country.\"\n\n\"The Forest Hills Superintendent should simply retract his apology and stand up for the students and community he represents,\" said one. \"All students across the country have the right to free speech. Kids aren't allowed to hold a flag? ...what's next, will the school band not be allowed the play the national anthem? Can't hold a Trump sign? ...what's next?\"\n\nOthers suggested that if they had been holding a Hillary Clinton banner, everything would have been different.\n\nOn the other side, Grand Rapids school superintendent Teresa Weatherall Neal \"thanked Behm for his leadership, and his letter and apology,\" MLive reported.\n\n\"I cannot deny the hurt, disrespect and outrage that I and so many others in this community felt about these actions that took place in our backyard, in our home at Houseman Field. This type of behavior should not and will not be tolerated in our stadium or schools \u2014 nor should it in any community across our state and nation.\"\n\nBriana Urena-Ravelo, a Grand Rapids resident and Black Lives Matter activist, explained to TV8 in Michigan why she thought the flag was offensive: \"What were the conditions for people of color when that flag was created? I was property. Other people were getting their land stolen,\" she said. \"It's all very obvious,\" she said.\n\nThe incident in Michigan appears to be a complicated matter of context \u2014 the combination of the flag, the predominantly white school, the Trump sign \u2014 all at a predominantly black school at a time of broader racial tension.\n\nBeyond that, it raises the question of whether America's first flag, along with the Confederate flag, is destined to become another point of controversy in the country, increasing the divisions that already exist.\n\nFor the general public, that would be a change.\n\nThe \"Betsy Ross\" flag is depicted on the Department of Veterans Affairs official shield.\n\nIt's routinely hauled out for Flag Day, and for other occasions. And yes, it's also been deployed from time to time by supporters of Donald Trump and by the Patriot movement, which contains some factions who espouse white nationalist and white supremacist views.\n\nForest Hills Schools parent Patricia Gerondale, whose son brought the Trump flag to the game, said the visiting students never intended any harm or intimidation. MLive reported. \"It wasn't done to put anyone down or cause any negative feeling,\" she said, and carried \"no message behind it.\"\n\nBut it's apparent that for some, that's not the case. This, in turn, raises the question as to whether white supremacist groups, or any extremist group, have the power to blemish symbols and icons simply by adopting them, to the point that they become offensive by association.\n\nFred Barbash, the editor of Morning Mix, is a former national editor and London bureau chief for the Washington Post.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "830L": "Opinion: Does the first flag promote racism?\nBy Washington Post, adapted by Newsela staff\n09.19.16\n\nA replica \"Betsy Ross\" flag is posted on the side of the Betsy Ross House in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on August 27, 2016.

Photo: AP Photo/Jared Wickerham\nPRO: Driverless cars could allow people to stay in the suburbs, and save them money\nMore than at any time in world history, technological advances are having a major effect on the way people live their lives.\n\nJust 30 years ago, few would have imagined it would be possible for every person to own their very own pocket-sized supercomputer that would allow them to do virtually anything, from finding a date to buying a house. Yet today's smartphone is a marvel.\n\nNow, the driverless car is another society-shifting invention that has the potential to become an everyday reality in the not-so-distant future.\n\nDriverless Cars Could Be Here By 2019\n\nIn April, Volkswagen\u2019s Johann Jungwirth predicted the first self-driving cars could appear on the market as early 2019. In May, General Motors\u2019 Richard Holman said driverless cars could become a reality in 2020.\n\nState governments have already started preparing for the new technology\u2019s arrival.\n\nCalifornia, Florida, Michigan and Nevada have recently passed laws governing their use. More than a dozen other states are currently considering similar legislation.\n\nPrivate Car Ownership Will Decline\n\nTraditionally, new technological developments put more products in the hands of consumers. However, many industry experts predict driverless cars will actually limit private car ownership.\n\nThe tech-savvy consumer of the future will no longer\u00a0spend thousands of dollars on a new car. Instead, they will\u00a0open an app on a computer or smartphone and call for their very own driverless chauffeur.\n\nDriverless cars have the potential to radically change the way people spend time with their families and commute to and from work. Most likely they will also alter where and how people live.\n\nSuburbs Versus Cities\n\nRecent data show that more and more people are moving to big cities. However, surveys suggest that people of all ages still prefer to live in affordable, convenient and spacious suburbs.\n\nOne 2015 poll showed that as many as two-thirds of young people would choose suburban living over life in the city.\n\nIf Americans still prefer the suburbs over city centers, why are so many choosing to live in cities?\n\nA number of factors are responsible for the shift from suburbs to cities that has occurred over the past two decades. One of the most important is the increasingly globalized economy, which is drawing people looking for work to major centers of technology and commerce.\n\nInternational centers of tech-commerce have developed in regions such as California\u2019s Silicon Valley, the Research Triangle in North Carolina and in major cities such as Chicago and New York.\n\nProfessionals who want to work in these growing tech fields or in related industries often need to be close to the action.\n\nSuburbs Offer A Better Quality Of Life\n\nThis does not mean, however, that cities typically offer a better quality of life \u2014 indeed, in most cases, they do not.\n\nSales taxes and income taxes are highest in some of the country\u2019s major cities, such as Chicago, New York, San Francisco and Seattle.\n\nCrime and pollution remain significantly worse in cities as well. In addition, regulations that limit businesses, especially small businesses, are worse in states with large cities, including California, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Illinois, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.\n\nDriverless cars have the potential to completely change the way Americans think about where they live. The commute from suburb to city center will become much less strenuous, so people will feel less need to live in the city itself. People will no longer need to pay the high rents, taxes and fees common in big cities in order to work comfortably in those places.\n\nWith driverless cars, driving to work will feel more like sitting at home on the couch watching a favorite television show.\n\nIf that is what the future looks like, most of us will not mind the extra commuting time.\n\nJustin Haskins is the executive editor of Heartland Institute, a conservative and libertarian public policy think tank.\nCON: Driverless cars pose major safety issues, and relying on them is unrealistic\nA nationwide network of millions of self-driving cars whisking suburban commuters to work is a pleasant utopian vision. However, getting to that point would be far from simple.\n\nSelf-driving cars have been in development for years, and their backers claim the vehicles will be ready to dominate the car market in the near future.\n\nHaving a nation of commuters use these vehicles, they claim, will reduce traffic congestion and improve highway safety. They say they will make even the far suburbs more convenient places to live.\n\nFully automated cars could make up 10 percent of global vehicle sales a year by 2035, some have predicted.\n\nHowever, before those suburban dwellers can order such cars, some gargantuan problems\u00a0must be overcome.\n\nSafety Issues Abound\n\nFirst, the technology used in those cars creates serious safety problems, and huge improvements must be made before they can safely handle streets.\n\nDeveloping fail-safe software for completely driverless cars would require rethinking how software is designed. The software in phones, laptops and other devices is not designed to operate for extended periods without crashing or freezing \u2014 and those errors would be deadly in a car.\n\nAlso, driverless cars rely primarily on pre-programmed route data, so they do not obey things such as temporary traffic lights. They also have problems figuring out when objects such as bits of paper garbage are harmless, so they may swerve for no reason.\n\nComputers Cannot Replace Humans\n\nThe vehicles simply cannot deal with the unexpected adventures that fill everyday life. Until the cars can self-drive at all times, humans are going to have to be ready to resume control.\n\nMeanwhile, Google\u2019s self-driving car has already run into another perplexing safety problem \u2014 human drivers.\n\nRecently, one of Google\u2019s self-driving cars came to a crosswalk and did what it was supposed to do \u2014 it slowed down to allow a pedestrian to cross. However, despite the slowing down, the human \u201csafety driver\u201d hit the brakes. The pedestrian emerged unhurt, but Google\u2019s car was hit from behind.\n\nMaps For Millions Of Miles\n\nFor driverless cars to work properly, detailed maps of streets and highways need to be loaded into the computers that guide them.\u00a0Currently the maps for Google\u2019s self-driving cars have only been designed to handle a few thousand miles of road.\u00a0Developing a nationwide self-driving car system would require countless amounts of effort and money.\u00a0To make a national system work, a company would have to maintain and update data on millions of miles of roads.\n\nThe development of these vehicles would also inevitably mean more state and federal regulation covering how, when and where driverless cars can be used.\n\nRegulators are notoriously cautious and whatever regulation they come up with is likely to hamper the rapid spread of driverless cars.\n\nLegal And Privacy Issues\n\nThe use of driverless cars would also raise issues of legal responsibility, such as who should be held responsible in the event of a crash \u2014 the passenger, the carmaker or the designer of the computer system. Such complicated legal issues could take years and many lawyers to sort out.\n\nThere is also a potential privacy problem: Each car\u2019s computer would store massive amounts of highly personal data that federal intelligence agencies, with their fondness for spying on us, might well grab to use against drivers.\n\nNo Love For Driverless Cars\n\nTotally self-driving cars will likely not be cheap, either.\u00a0One report says the ability to drive anywhere with no human input would add some $10,000 to a car's sticker price, at least during the first decade the technology is on the market.\n\nThere is also the problem of getting people to accept them. Cars are not just transportation \u2014 they reflect our personalities and tastes.\u00a0Imagine someone who loves zooming down the highway behind the wheel of a sleek and speedy sports car.\u00a0It will be hard to get them to accept riding as a passenger in a not-very-exciting computer-controlled vehicle.\n\nWhitt Flora is an independent journalist who covered the White House for the Columbus Dispatch and was chief congressional correspondent for Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "800L": "PRO/CON: Self-driving cars could take over the road in the near future\nBy Tribune News Service, adapted by Newsela staff\n09.14.16\n\nA self-driving Ford Fusion hybrid car is test driven in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on August 18, 2016.

The changes are coming faster than at any time in human history.\n\nThirty years ago, few could imagine a day when everyone could have their own pocket-sized supercomputer. Yet that is just what today's smartphone is.\n\nNow, the driverless car is also set to bring big changes. It too could become part of everyday life in the near future.\n\nOn The Market In Three Or Four Years\n\nCarmakers like Volkswagen and General Motors say they are almost ready to begin selling driverless cars. They say they will be on the market in just three or four years.\n\nOnce the driverless cars arrive fewer people will buy their own cars.\n\nPeople will no longer have to spend thousands of dollars on a new car. Instead, when they need to get somewhere they will simply call for a driverless taxi.\n\nDriverless cars may completely change the way people travel to and from work. Most likely they will also change where and how people live.\n\nSuburbs Win Over Cities\n\nMore and more people in the U.S. have been moving to big cities. However, many would rather live in the suburbs. These towns outside the big cities are cheaper to live in and not as crowded. Life is easier and you can have more space.\n\nSo why are so many Americans moving to big cities anyway?\n\nThere are a number of reasons. One of the most important is that many of the best jobs are in big cities.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that cities offer a better quality of life. In most cases, they do not.\n\nBig cities like Chicago, New York, San Francisco and Seattle have the country's highest taxes.\u00a0Crime and pollution remain far worse in cities as well.\n\nCommuting Will Be Less Of A Chore\n\nDriverless cars could completely change the way Americans think about where they live. Traveling from suburb to city center will become much less tiring. People will no longer have to do the driving themselves.\u00a0\n\nBecause of that, people will feel less need to live where they work. They will no longer be forced to pay the high rents and taxes common in big cities.\n\nWith driverless cars, driving to and from work will be easy. Instead of being tiring, it will be relaxing. Passengers will be able to catch up on their reading or watch their favorite television shows.\n\nFewer people who work in big cities will feel the need to live in those cities. Instead, they will stay put in nearby suburbs. Once getting to work becomes easy, most of us will not mind the extra travel time.\n\nJustin Haskins is the executive editor of Heartland Institute, a conservative and libertarian public policy think tank.\nCON: Driverless cars are expensive and unsafe\nHaving driverless cars take millions of people to and from work each day sounds like a great idea. Actually making that happen will be very difficult, however. Big problems stand in the way.\n\nCarmakers have been working on self-driving cars for years. They say the vehicles will be ready to take over the car market in the near future.\n\nSupporters claim having millions of driverless cars will improve highway safety. Driverless cars will make even the far suburbs more convenient places to live, they say.\n\nMany Problems Need To Be Tackled First\n\nHowever, some huge problems still need to be solved.\u00a0\n\nFirst, driverless cars are still not very safe.\n\nDriverless cars are guided by computers. Those computers rely on information about roads that is loaded into them. If something on the road changes, they are lost.\u00a0For example, they would not obey a new stop sign.\u00a0\n\nThey also have problems figuring out when objects such as bits of paper garbage are harmless. For that reason, they can change course suddenly for no reason. Such sudden shifts make crashes more likely.\n\nDriverless cars simply cannot deal with changes or anything at all unusual. Passengers still must be ready to take over at a moment's notice.\n\nPassengers who do take the wheel can also cause problems, though.\n\nRecently, a driverless car came to a crosswalk and did what it was supposed to do. It slowed down to allow someone on foot to cross the street. However, the human \u201csafety driver\u201d panicked and hit the brakes. No one was hurt, but the driverless car was hit from behind by another car.\n\nMany More Maps Needed\n\nA driverless car cannot work unless road maps are loaded into the car's computer.\u00a0Currently, the maps for Google\u2019s self-driving cars only cover a few thousand miles of road. For driverless cars to work everywhere, millions of miles of roads would need to be entered. Updates would be needed anytime a road or road signs were changed.\n\nNew laws will have to be written for driverless cars too. They will be hard to figure out. For example, who should be held responsible if a driverless car crashes? Would it be the fault of the passenger, the carmaker or the designer of the computer system? It could take judges and courts years to figure it all out.\n\nTotally self-driving cars will not be cheap, either. Making a car completely self-driving would add around $10,000 to its price.\n\nPeople Love Their Cars\n\nThere is also the problem of getting people to accept driverless cars. Our cars are not just transportation. They also reflect our tastes and who we are.\u00a0\n\nSome people love driving down the highway in a fast sports car.\u00a0It will be hard to get them to accept a driverless vehicle. For them, driverless cars would take all the fun out of driving.\n\nWhitt Flora is an independent journalist who covered the White House for the Columbus Dispatch and was chief congressional correspondent for Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "PRO/CON: Are self-driving cars the future of transportation?\nBy Justin Haskins and Whitt Flora, Tribune News Service\n09.14.16\n\nA self-driving Ford Fusion hybrid car is test driven in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on August 18, 2016.

In most cases, they don\u2019t.\n\nCombined city and state sales and income taxes are highest in some of the country\u2019s most influential cities, such as Chicago, New York, San Francisco and Seattle.\n\nCrime and pollution remain significantly worse in cities as well. And according to the Kauffman Foundation, regulations that limit businesses, especially small businesses, are worse in states with large urban centers, including California, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Illinois, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.\n\nDriverless cars have the potential to completely change the way Americans think about where they live. No longer will people need to pay the high rents, taxes and fees common in urban centers to work comfortably in those cities.\n\nWhile traffic congestion may still be an issue for many, driving to work in the future could look and feel more like sitting at home on the couch watching a favorite show on Netflix.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s what the future looks like, who wouldn\u2019t mind spending more time commuting?\n\nJustin Haskins is the executive editor of Heartland Institute, a conservative and libertarian public policy think tank.\nCON: Driverless cars face gargantuan hurdles before going anywhere\nA nationwide network of millions of self-driving cars whisking suburban commuters to work is a pleasant utopian vision, but getting there would almost rival the Manhattan Project in terms of complexity.\n\nSelf-driving cars have been in development for years, and their backers claim the vehicles will be ready to dominate the car market in the near future.\n\nHaving a nation of commuters use these vehicles, they claim, will reduce traffic congestion, improve highway safety and make even the far suburbs more convenient places to live.\n\nFully automated cars could make up nearly 10 percent of global vehicle sales a year, by 2035, the Boston Consulting Group has predicted.\n\nBut before those suburban dwellers can order such cars, some gargantuan problems with safety, technology, cost, acceptance, federal bureaucrats and other drivers must be overcome.\n\nFirst, the technology used in those cars creates serious safety problems, and huge improvements must be made before they can safely handle streets.\n\nDeveloping fail-safe software for completely driverless cars would require rethinking how software is designed, some experts say. They note that the software in phones, laptops and other devices is not designed to operate for extended periods without crashing or freezing \u2014 and those errors would be deadly in a car.\n\nAlso, driverless cars rely primarily on pre-programmed route data, so they don\u2019t obey things such as temporary traffic lights. They also have problems figuring out when objects such as strewn papers are harmless, so they may swerve for no reason.\n\nThe vehicles simply can\u2019t deal with the unexpected adventures that fill everyday life. Until the cars can self-drive at all times, humans are going to have to be ready to resume control.\n\nMeanwhile, as a recent article in The New York Times pointed out, Google\u2019s self-driving car has already run into another perplexing safety problem: human drivers.\n\nThe story recounts that when one of Google\u2019s self-driving cars came to a crosswalk, it did what it was supposed to do in slowing to allow a pedestrian to cross. However, that action prompted the human \u201csafety driver\u201d to apply the brakes. The pedestrian emerged unhurt, but Google\u2019s car was hit from behind.\n\nMeanwhile, developing a nationwide self-driving car system would require countless amounts of effort and money. Currently the maps for Google\u2019s self-driving cars have only been designed to handle a few thousand miles of road. To make a national system work, a company would have to maintain and update data on millions of miles of roads.\n\nIn another area, the development of these vehicles inevitably means more state and federal regulation, a process already underway by some state governments and at least one federal agency.\n\nRegulation is the enemy of innovation, and regulators are notoriously risk-averse. They surely will tie the cars up in miles of paralyzing red tape because government at all levels will do what government loves to do: regulate and overregulate.\n\nThe widespread use of driverless cars would also raise issues of legal liability, such as who\u2019s liable when one has a wreck, something that could take years and many lawyers to sort out.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a potential privacy problem: Each car\u2019s computer would store massive amounts of highly personal data that feds agencies, with their penchant for spying on us, might well grab to use against drivers.\n\nOf course, nobody knows the cost of totally self-driving cars. However, one report says cars with the ability to drive anywhere with no human input would add some $10,000 to the sticker price, at least in the first decade the technology\u2019s on the market.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of getting people to accept them. Cars aren\u2019t just transportation; they reflect our personalities and tastes.\n\nIt\u2019ll be hard to get someone wanting to zoom down the highway in a fast open convertible to meekly accept riding as a passive passenger in a computer-controlled vehicle.\n\nWhitt Flora is an independent journalist who covered the White House for the Columbus Dispatch and was chief congressional correspondent for Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "580L": "PRO/CON: How safe are cars that can drive themselves?\nBy Tribune News Service, adapted by Newsela staff\n09.14.16\n\nA self-driving Ford Fusion hybrid car is test driven in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on August 18, 2016.

They could be here in just three or four years.\n\nDriverless cars will change all sorts of things. For one, fewer people will buy their own cars.\n\nPeople will no longer have to spend tons of money on a new car. Instead, they will reach for a smartphone. They will simply call for a driverless car to pick them up.\n\nChoosing To Stay In The Suburbs\n\nDriverless cars will change the way people travel. It will make the drive to work easier. They will also change where people live.\n\nMore and more people have been moving to big cities. Yet, many would rather live in the suburbs. These towns are outside of the big cities. They are cheaper to live in. They are also not as crowded. People can have more space.\n\nSo why are so many Americans moving to big cities anyway?\n\nThere are a number of reasons. One of the most important is that many of the best jobs are in big cities.\n\nAt the same time, life is harder in the big cities. Big cities cost more to live in. They are dirtier, too.\n\nDriverless cars will change the way Americans think about where they live.\n\nTraveling To Work Will Be Relaxing\n\nDriving to and from work will be easy. Instead of being tiring, it will be relaxing. Passengers will be able to catch up on their reading. They will be able to watch TV.\n\nFewer people who work in big cities will have to live in those cities. Instead, they will stay in nearby suburbs. Getting to work will be so easy. They will not even mind some extra travel time.\n\nJustin Haskins is the executive editor of Heartland Institute, a conservative and libertarian public policy think tank.\nCON: Driverless cars are not very safe\nDriverless cars sound like a great idea. There are still some very big problems with them, though.\n\nSome people say the cars will make things safer. People will not need as many cars. More people will be able to live further from cities.\n\nDriverless cars are still not very safe, though.\n\nComputers Are Not Always Reliable\n\nThese cars are guided by computers. Those computers need to have road maps loaded into them. If something on the road changes, they are lost.\u00a0For example, they would not understand a new stop sign.\u00a0\n\nIf something is lying in the road they can become confused. Even a piece of paper can make them change course suddenly. Such sudden shifts make crashes more likely.\n\nDriverless cars cannot handle changes or anything unusual. Passengers still need to be ready to take the wheel.\n\nDriverless Cars Are No Fun\n\nA driverless car cannot work unless road maps are loaded into the car's computer. Millions and millions of miles of road still need to be entered. Catching up will take a long time. It will cost a great deal of money.\n\nNot everyone will like the idea of driverless cars, either.\u00a0\n\nSome people like to do the driving themselves. They love zooming down the highway.

Most likely they will also alter where and how people live.\n\nIn recent years, more and more people in the U.S. have been moving to big cities. However, groups have been sending out surveys which show that people of all ages still prefer to live in suburbs, because they are more affordable, convenient and spacious.\n\nOne 2015 poll showed that as many as two-thirds of young people would choose suburban living over life in the city.\n\nIf Americans still prefer the suburbs over city centers, why are so many choosing to live in cities?\n\nCities Hold The Best Jobs\n\nThere are a number of reasons for the shift from suburbs to cities. One of the most important is that many of the most desirable new jobs are in the tech industry, and many tech companies are located in big cities.\n\nPeople who want to work in tech often need to be close to the action.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that cities typically offer a better quality of life. In most cases, they do not.\n\nTaxes are highest in some of the country\u2019s major cities, such as Chicago, New York, San Francisco and Seattle.\u00a0Crime and pollution remain significantly worse in cities as well.\n\nCommuting Will Become Easy\n\nDriverless cars could completely change the way Americans think about where they live. Traveling from suburb to city center will become much less tiring, as people will no longer have to do the driving themselves. Because of that, people will feel less need to live where they work. They will no longer be forced to pay the high rents, taxes and fees common in big cities in order to work comfortably in those places.\n\nWith driverless cars, driving to work will be a breeze. Instead of being an exhausting trek, it will feel more like sitting at home on the couch watching a favorite television show.\n\nIf that is what the future looks like, most of us will not mind the extra travel time.\n\nJustin Haskins is the executive editor of Heartland Institute, a conservative and libertarian public policy think tank.\nCON: Driverless cars will bring about major safety and legal issues\nA nationwide network of millions of self-driving cars whisking suburban commuters to work is a pleasant vision.

Huge improvements must be made before they can safely handle streets.\n\nDriverless cars rely primarily on pre-programmed information about routes. If something on the road changes, they are lost. For example, they would not obey a short-term stop sign. They also have problems figuring out when objects such as bits of paper garbage are harmless, so they can change course abruptly for no reason.\n\nThe vehicles simply cannot deal with the unexpected adventures that fill everyday life. Until the cars can self-drive at all times, humans are going to have to be ready to take over at a moment's notice.\n\nHuman Error Causes Problems\n\nMeanwhile, Google\u2019s self-driving car has already run into another perplexing safety problem: human drivers.\n\nRecently, one of Google\u2019s self-driving cars came to a crosswalk and did what it was supposed to do: It slowed down to allow someone on foot to cross the street.

Car companies\u00a0would need to maintain and update information on millions of miles of roads.\n\nRegulation Roadblocks\n\nThe development of driverless vehicles would also mean more state and federal regulation. There would be all sorts of new rules covering how, when and where driverless cars can be used. Most likely, all those new rules would significantly slow the spread of driverless cars.\n\nThe use of driverless cars would also raise issues of legal responsibility. For example, who should be held responsible in the event of a crash \u2014 the passenger, the carmaker or the designer of the computer system? Such complicated legal issues could take years and many lawyers to sort out.\n\nPaying The Price\n\nTotally self-driving cars will likely not be cheap, either.

Photo: P Photo/Carolyn Kaster File\nThirsty students in 30 St. Louis, Missouri, public schools cannot use the drinking fountains.\u00a0After this summer's lead-poisoning crisis in Flint, Michigan, officials tested water at the St. Louis schools, where many buildings are decades old and need repair. At some schools, results were bad enough to shut off the drinking fountains immediately. More than 12 of the buildings had at least one reading four or five times higher than those in Flint.\n\nThere was at least one fountain at another school where test results exceeded the district's lead limit. However, officials determined that there was enough clean water available in other parts of the school to keep most of the taps running.\n\nNearby, at Reed Elementary School in suburban Ladue, Missouri,\u00a0the water will be cold and clean. The town often ranks as one of the nation's wealthiest. In fact, thanks to a recent fundraiser, a drinking fountain there might soon find itself inscribed with a generous donor's name, a reminder to thirsty students that they live in a place where clean water is a privilege.\n\nThe water fountain serves as a metaphor for racial division in a region that has been in the national civil rights consciousness since August 9, 2014, when Michael Brown was killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri. In St. Louis city schools, 82 percent of the students are black, and 85 percent qualify for free lunch. In Ladue, only 17 percent are black, and just 12 percent qualify for free lunch.\n\nMore Resources Poured Into Wealthy Suburbs\n\nLast year, voters in Ladue agreed to set aside $85 million to build new schools and update already first-class facilities. However, the district wanted even more money, so the Ladue Education Foundation decided to hold a fundraiser. They earned hundreds of thousands\u00a0of dollars from the region's wealthiest citizens by selling naming rights. Available for naming were rooms and hallways, performing arts centers, football stadiums and, yes, water fountains.\n\nThe price for getting a school drinking fountain labeled with a person's name is $3,000. For a whole stadium, the price tag is $600,000.\n\nTwo zip codes away, children have been sucking poisonous lead into their tiny bodies for who knows how long. The difference brings to mind the words of Judge Byron Kinder. In 1993, he declared Missouri's school-funding plan irrational and unconstitutional.\u00a0Pointing to big imbalances in the state, Kinder wrote that school funding in Missouri ranged from \"the golden to the god-awful.\"\n\nIt is hard to imagine anything more god-awful than children who go to school and swallow IQ-robbing heavy metal, thanks to the taxpayers. Meanwhile, children just blocks away get donor-named water fountains in hallways paved with engraved bricks that sell for $350 each.\n\nDivision by race and class is generational, and is not unique to St. Louis. Last week, the nonprofit company EdBuild published a list of the nation's 50 most segregated school district borders. Demographic differences such as poverty level, average home prices and school funding were used to create the list. St. Louis was on the list, as were districts from all over the country, including Detroit, Michigan and its border with Grosse Point, Michigan. Birmingham, Alabama, and its border with Vestavia Hills, Alabama also made the list. In both the Michigan and Alabama examples, the difference in poverty between the bordering districts is more than 40 percent.\n\nIn 1993, Kinder noted that the inequality in state support for Missouri public schools had existed for years. It is a property-tax-based system that has discrimination built into it. That is what the Spainhower Commission noted more than 20 years before, in 1968. The group urged lawmakers to change school-district boundaries and create one district in St. Louis instead of 24 so that children seeking to quench their thirst would have the same opportunity, no matter what neighborhood they lived in.\u00a0\n\nSpainhower was ignored, and so\u00a0was Kinder. Lawmakers have adjusted the funding formula for schools over the years, but the differences remain, and so does the massive\u00a0underfunding. Middle-class white parents are not directly invested in\u00a0the success of inner-city black children, and this is a problem that leads to racial inequity.\n\nLead Poisoning In St. Louis Spans Generations\n\nA few months ago, I watched two children wander around barefoot in their north St. Louis home, playing with their toys in a mostly empty room.\u00a0Aaliyah and Rashaud Dinwiddie\u00a0had just moved across the\u00a0street because their old apartment had lead paint. Health department testing had found levels of lead in both children that were among the highest recorded in St. Louis last year. Rashaud, 5, started public school this month in a city that continues to poison its children.\n\nIn 2014, more than 3,000 children in St. Louis had lead levels high enough to cause developmental delays. Officials thought that the lead problem was related to lead-based paint in older houses, but water at the schools had never been tested.\n\nThe Dinwiddie children are at least the second generation in their family to have lead poisoning. Their father and his brother both had lead poisoning as children, and went to a high school that put yellow tape around its drinking fountains this week.\n\nTwo years ago, I seethed with anger as I looked at images night after night of armored vehicles facing young protesters in Ferguson. \"This is not St. Louis,\" I screamed.\u00a0I insisted that\u00a0St. Louis was better than the violent images of police in militarized gear pushing black protesters into a corner.\n\nBut this is St. Louis. As long as children in wealthy suburbs have drinking fountains flowing with clean water while children in the city's poorest neighborhoods have crime tape surrounding theirs, St. Louis is a region divided by race and class in the most disgusting way.\n\nTony Messenger, metro columnist at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, was a 2015 Pulitzer Prize finalist for a series of editorials on Ferguson.

Photo: P Photo/Carolyn Kaster File\nStudents cannot use the drinking fountains in 30 St. Louis, Missouri, public schools. Water flows through lead pipes in the old school buildings, and comes out poisoned. Lead is a metal that causes many health problems.\u00a0Last summer, thousands of children in another city, Flint, Michigan, were exposed to lead-poisoned drinking water. After that, leaders checked the water at the\u00a0nearby\u00a0St. Louis, Missouri schools. The results showed lead in the water there, too. Drinking fountains were shut off at some St. Louis schools.\u00a0Some fountains there had much more lead than those in Flint.\n\nReed Elementary School is close by, in\u00a0Ladue, Missouri. The town is very rich. There, the water is cold and clean.\u00a0In fact, the schools got money from people to put\u00a0name plates on drinking fountains at the schools. Thirsty students can see that they live in a place where clean water is for people who have money.\n\nThe water fountain is a symbol of differences in skin color. St. Louis is in the same area as\u00a0Ferguson, Missouri where Michael Brown was killed by Ferguson police on\u00a0August 9, 2014. He was 18 years old. Since then, people around the country have been talking about civil rights.\u00a0In St. Louis, 8 out of 10 students are black. In Ladue, only 2 out of 10 students are black.\n\nWealthy Schools Getting More Money\n\nLadue already plans to spend millions of dollars on schools there. The town figured out how to raise even more money. People could give money to name rooms and hallways after themselves. They could name buildings, football fields, and even water fountains.\n\nThe price for getting a school drinking fountain labeled with a person's name is $3,000. For a whole stadium, the price tag is $600,000.\n\nNearby, children have been sucking poisonous lead into their tiny bodies for a long time. In 1993, Missouri Judge Byron Kinder noticed. He said that the state did not give money to its schools equally.\n\nIt is hard to imagine anything worse than children who swallow lead in their drinking water. Meanwhile, children just blocks away get water fountains with names on them.\n\nPeople are divided by their skin color and how much money they have. St. Louis is not the only place that this is happening. Last week, a company shared a list of the 50 most divided areas, where rich school districts are next to poor ones. St. Louis was on the list, and so were many districts from all over the country. \u00a0\n\nIn 1968, a group asked leaders to make one school district in St. Louis instead of 24. Then, thirsty kids would all have the same water. It would not depend on what town they lived in.\u00a0\n\nThe change did not happen. Leaders have made small changes in the money that schools get, but the differences remain. White parents with money are not affected by how well poor black children are doing in school, a problem that leads to unfair differences.\n\nPoor Students Suffering From Lead Poisoning\n\nA few months ago, I watched two children play in their St. Louis home. Aaliyah and Rashaud Dinwiddie\u00a0had just moved across the\u00a0street. Their old apartment had lead paint. Health department testing found very high levels of lead in both children. Rashaud is 5 years old, and started public school this month in a city that continues to poison its children.\n\nTwo years ago, more than 3,000 children in St. Louis had lead levels high enough to cause health problems. Leaders thought that the lead problem was because of lead paint in houses. However, the water at the schools had never been tested.\n\nSt. Louis is an area divided by skin color and money in the most disgusting way.\u00a0Children in rich parts of town have drinking fountains flowing with clean water.

Last week, the nonprofit EdBuild published a list of the nation's 50 most segregated school-district borders as defined by demographic differences such as poverty level, median home prices and school funding. Accompanying St. Louis on the list were districts from all over the country, including Detroit's city schools and their border with Grosse Point, and Birmingham, Alabama, and its border with Vestavia Hills. In both the Michigan and Alabama examples, the difference in poverty between the bordering districts is more than 40 percent.\n\nWhen Kinder tossed the old funding scheme in 1993, he noted that the problem of disparity in state support for public schools had existed for decades. It's a property-tax-based system that has discrimination built into it. That's what the Spainhower Commission noted in 1968 when it urged lawmakers to redraw school-district boundaries, creating one district in St. Louis -- not 24 -- so that children seeking to quench their thirst would have the same opportunity to do so no matter what neighborhood they lived in.\n\nSpainhower was ignored.\n\nSo, too, was Kinder. Lawmakers have tweaked the funding formula for schools over the years, but the disparities remain, and so does the massive underfunding. That middle-class white parents (I am one of them) aren't directly invested in the success of inner-city black children is a structural problem that inherently leads to racial inequity. The system is broken, and that is one reason why St. Louis remains a city divided.\n\nA few months ago, I watched young Aaliyah and Rashaud Dinwiddie wander around barefoot in their north St. Louis home, playing with their toys in a mostly furnitureless room. They had just moved across the street because their old apartment had lead paint. Health department testing had found levels of lead in both children that were among the highest recorded in St. Louis last year. Rashaud, 5, started public school this month in a city that continues to poison its children.\n\nIn 2014, more than 3,000 children in St. Louis were found to have lead levels high enough to potentially cause developmental delays. Much of this lead problem has been thought to be related to lead-based paint in older housing stock. But water at the schools had never been tested.\n\nThe Dinwiddie children are at least the second generation in their family to have lead poisoning. Their father, Shaun, and his brother, Juron, both had lead poisoning as children. They attended Beaumont High School, which this week put yellow tape around its drinking fountains.\n\nTwo years ago, like many in my city and nationwide, I seethed with anger as I looked at images night after night of armored vehicles seeming to lay siege to young protesters in Ferguson. \"This is not St. Louis,\" I screamed into a digital recorder for a video editorial I produced that pleaded for the madness to stop. St. Louis was better than the violent images of police in militarized gear cordoning black protesters into a corner, I insisted.\n\nBut this is St. Louis. As long as children in wealthy suburbs have donor-funded drinking fountains flowing with clean water while children in the city's poorest neighborhoods have crime tape surrounding theirs, this is a region divided by race and class in the most despicable of ways.\n\nTony Messenger, metro columnist at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, was a 2015 Pulitzer Prize finalist for a series of editorials on Ferguson.

Photo: P Photo/Carolyn Kaster File\nIn 30 public schools in\u00a0St. Louis, Missouri, students can't drink the water. They cannot use the drinking fountains. Water flows through lead pipes in old buildings. It comes out poisoned. Lead is a metal that can cause people to get sick.\u00a0\n\nLast summer, thousands of children drank lead-poisoned water. They were in Flint. It is a city in Michigan.\u00a0When leaders heard that, they checked the water at St. Louis, Missouri schools. It is close by. The water there had lead,\u00a0too. Drinking fountains were then shut off. \u00a0\n\nReed Elementary School is close by in\u00a0Ladue, Missouri. The town is very rich. There, the water is clean.\n\nThe water fountain is a symbol of how skin color makes a difference. In St. Louis, most students are black. In Ladue, most students are white.\n\nCity Sells Parts Of Schools\n\nLadue already spends a lot of money on schools. The town figured out how to get even more money. People could name rooms and hallways after themselves. They could name buildings, football fields and even water fountains.\n\nThe price for getting a school drinking fountain labeled with a person's name is $3,000. For a football field, the price is $600,000.\n\nNearby in St. Louis, children were drinking lead in the water. In 1993, Missouri judge Byron Kinder noticed. He said the state did not spend money on its schools equally.\n\nIt is hard to imagine anything worse. Some children swallow lead in their drinking water. Just blocks away in Ladue, children get water fountains with names on them.\n\nPeople are split up by skin color and money. St. Louis is not the only place where this happens. It is the same way in many parts of the country. \u00a0\n\nMany years ago, a group asked leaders to make a change. Right now,\u00a0St. Louis\u00a0has 24 school districts.\u00a0The group wanted all of St. Louis to be one school district. Then, thirsty kids would all have the same water.\n\nThe change did not happen. Leaders only\u00a0made\u00a0small changes. White parents with money are not affected by how well poor black students are doing in school.\n\nMore Lead In Poor Neighborhoods\n\nA few months ago, I watched two children play in their home. Aaliyah and Rashaud Dinwiddie\u00a0had just moved. Their old apartment had lead in the paint. Both kids had high amounts of lead in their blood. Rashaud is 5 years old, and just started public school in a city that poisons its children.\n\nSt. Louis is a city divided by skin color and money.\u00a0Rich children have drinking fountains with clean water. Poor children cannot drink the water in their schools.\n\nTony Messenger, metro columnist at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, was a 2015 Pulitzer Prize finalist for a series of editorials on Ferguson.

Photo: P Photo/Carolyn Kaster File\nDrinking fountains are off limits to thirsty students in 30 St. Louis, Missouri, public schools.\u00a0After thousands of children were exposed to lead-contaminated drinking water in Flint, Michigan, officials tested the water at the St. Louis, Missouri schools. At some, the results were horrifying. The drinking fountains were immediately shut off.\u00a0More than 12 of the buildings had at least one reading almost five times higher than those in Flint.\n\nReed Elementary School is close by, in\u00a0Ladue, Missouri, one of the nation's wealthiest towns.\u00a0There, the water is cold and clean.\u00a0In fact, thanks to a recent fundraiser, drinking fountains at the school might soon be inscribed with a generous donor's name. Thirsty students will know that they live in a place where clean water is a privilege.\n\nThe water fountain serves as a metaphor for racial division. St. Louis is in the same area as\u00a0Ferguson, Missouri, which\u00a0has been the focus of national civil rights awareness since 18-year-old\u00a0Michael Brown was killed by police on\u00a0August 9, 2014. In St. Louis city schools, 82 percent of the students are black, and 85 percent qualify for free lunch. In Ladue, only 17 percent are black. Just 12 percent qualify for free lunch.\n\nTown Sells Naming Rights To Schools\n\nLast year, Ladue citizens voted to spend $85 million on schools. The plan is to build new schools and update buildings that are already in good shape. However, the district wanted even more money, so the town decided to hold a fundraiser. They earned hundreds of thousands more by selling naming rights. Available for naming were rooms, hallways, performing arts centers, football stadiums and, yes, water fountains.\n\nThe price for getting a school drinking fountain labeled with a person's name is $3,000. For a whole stadium, the price tag is $600,000.\n\nNext door, children have been sucking poisonous lead into their tiny bodies for who knows how long. The difference brings to mind the words of Missouri Judge Byron Kinder. In 1993, he called Missouri's school-funding plan irrational and unconstitutional. Kinder wrote that school funding in Missouri ranged from \"the golden to the god-awful.\"\n\nIt is hard to imagine anything more god-awful than children who go to school and swallow lead-contaminated drinking water. Meanwhile, children just blocks away get donor-named water fountains.\n\nDivision by race and class has existed for years, and is not unique to St. Louis. Last week, a company published a list of the 50 school district borders that are most segregated, with rich schools nearby to poor ones. Differences such as poverty level, average home prices and school funding were considered. St. Louis was on the list, as were districts from all over the country. Detroit, Michigan and its border with Grosse Point, Michigan was noted. Birmingham, Alabama, and its border with Vestavia Hills, Alabama also made the list. In both examples, the difference in poverty between the bordering districts is more than 40 percent.\n\nIn 1993 Kinder said that the inequality in funding for Missouri public schools has existed for years. It is based on property taxes and has discrimination built into it. Another group, the Spainhower Commission, noted the same thing in 1968. It urged lawmakers to create one district in St. Louis instead of 24. Then, children seeking to quench their thirst would have the same opportunity, no matter what neighborhood they lived in.\u00a0\n\nKinder and Spainhower were both ignored. Lawmakers have adjusted the funding formula for schools over the years, but the differences remain. Middle-class white parents are not directly invested in\u00a0the success of inner-city black children, a problem that leads to racial inequity.\n\nThousands Of Poor Children Exposed To Lead\n\nA few months ago, I watched two children wander around barefoot in their north St. Louis home.

They went to a high school that put yellow tape around its drinking fountains just this week.\n\nIn 2014, more than 3,000 children in St. Louis had lead levels high enough to cause developmental delays. Officials thought that the lead problem was related to lead-based paint in older houses. However, the water at the schools had never been tested.\n\nTwo years ago, I seethed with anger as I looked at images of armored vehicles facing young protesters in Ferguson. \"This is not St. Louis,\" I screamed.\n\nIt is St. Louis, though, a\u00a0region divided by race and class in the most disgusting way.\u00a0Children in wealthy suburbs have drinking fountains flowing with clean water, while children in the city's poorest neighborhoods have crime tape surrounding theirs.\n\nTony Messenger, metro columnist at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, was a 2015 Pulitzer Prize finalist for a series of editorials on Ferguson.

The actors who voice the characters are from the same places as the characters they play.\n\n\"Moana\" is about a young princess looking for an imaginary Pacific island. Moana is voiced by Auli'i Cravalho. Cravalho is from a real island in the Pacific Ocean \u2014 Hawaii.\n\nOther actors' voices in the movie are from Pacific islands, too. American actor Dwayne Johnson (\"The Rock\") is the voice of Moana's friend Maui. Johnson's mother is from Samoa. Actors Jemaine Clement, Temuera Morrison and Rachel House are part Maori. This is a group of people native to New Zealand. And actress Nicole Scherzinger has Hawaiian roots.\n\n\"Moana\" is different. Why? This is because many other animated movies don't hire actors of color to match the characters of color in the movies. Instead, they hire white actors to voice black, Asian and Hispanic characters. This is called \"whitewashing.\"\n\nAnimated Movies Lack Actors Of Color\n\nOne example of \"whitewashing\" is in the new movie \"Kubo and the Two Strings.\" The movie was made by Laika/Focus Features and is set in ancient Japan. However, many of the main voice actors are white, not Japanese. There are Japanese actors in the cast. But they voice smaller characters even though the story is set in their home country.\n\nOn Twitter, people have written about their frustration when white actors play nonwhite characters. They tweet \"#CartoonsSoWhite.\"\n\nOne group that has spoken out is the Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA). The person in charge of MANAA is Guy Aoki. He said he doesn't understand why white actors voice an entire Japanese family in \"Kubo.\"\n\nA Chinese-American cartoonist named Gene Luen Yang agrees with Aoki. Lalo Alcaraz, who writes and creates TV shows, said many movies in the last 10 years have cast almost all white actors.\n\nTravis Knight works for the company that made \"Kubo.\" He said that Laika cares about people of color.\n\nNot New In Hollywood\n\nAll types of movies in Hollywood are blamed for \"whitewashing.\"\n\nFor example, a white actor plays a character who is part Asian and part Hawaiian in the movie \"Aloha.\" The movie \"The Last Airbender\" was set in the South Pole, but featured white actors.\n\nNo More #CartoonsSoWhite For \"Moana\"\n\n\"Moana\" shows how Disney changed who is hired for animated movies. Disney made sure the actors are from the same places as the stories' characters.\n\nTwo movies are examples of this change. In 1992, Disney directors John Musker and Ron Clements supervised and released the movie \"Aladdin.\" The movie had many white voice actors for the main characters, but also included an Asian-American actress named Lea Salonga. She also voiced a character in \"Mulan.\" In addition, Disney released the 2009 movie \"The Princess and the Frog.\" The movie featured the voices of Oprah Winfrey and Terrence Howard, who are black.\n\nThese movies are different from most other Hollywood movies and they set an example.\n\nMichael Cavna is an American cartoonist and \"Comic Riffs\" columnist for The Washington Post.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "1210L": "Opinion: \"Moana\" casts actors who match the culture of their characters\nBy Michael Cavna, Washington Post, adapted by Newsela staff\n08.31.16\n\nAn image from Disney's forthcoming \"Moana.\" Photo: Disney\nWhen the Disney movie \"Moana\" is released this November, it will feel different to many moviegoers for an unusual reason. Unlike many others before it, this animated Hollywood film cast features voice actors of color to match the depicted culture or character in the story.\n\n\"Moana\" is about a young woman looking for a fabled Pacific island, with demigod Maui in tow. The main character, Princess Moana, is voiced by young Hawaiian native Auli'i Cravalho. Maui is voiced by American actor Dwayne Johnson (\"The Rock\"), whose mother is of Samoan descent.\n\nThe voice cast also features several actors from New Zealand who are part Maori (a native group of New Zealand). They are Jemaine Clement (from \"Flight of the Conchords\"), Temuera Morrison and Rachel House. Actress Nicole Scherzinger, who has Hawaiian and Filipino roots, is also part of the voice cast.\n\n\"Kubo\" Received Criticism For Its Casting\n\n\"Moana\" will arrive after a different American animated film received complaints for having white actors voice the Japanese characters.\n\n\"Kubo and the Two Strings\" opened Friday and is set in ancient Japan. The lead roles in the movie, produced by Laika/Focus Features, are voiced by white people. The all-star lineup includes Oscar winners Matthew McConaughey and Charlize Theron and Oscar nominees Rooney Mara and Ralph Fiennes. White Irish-born teen actor Art Parkinson voices the title role. The only Japanese actors in the cast hold secondary roles. They are George Takei, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Minae Noji, Alpha Takahashi and Ken Takemoto.\n\nIn other words, often when it comes to casting leading voices in animated films, \"#CartoonsSoWhite.\"\n\nThe watchdog group Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) criticized Laika for casting white actors in the leading roles. \"Why are white actors playing an entire extended Japanese family?\" MANAA's founding president Guy Aoki says in his criticism. MANAA looks for issues like diversity and inequality that go against public interest and speaks up in hopes of inspiring change.\n\nGene Luen Yang, a Chinese-American cartoonist, says the decision not to hire Japanese actors for \"Kubo\" is strange. \"There are so many Asian-American actors these days. It makes me wonder why they didn't just go with one of them,\" Yang says.\n\nHollywood's Casting History Lacks Diversity\n\nHollywood at large has increasingly faced accusations of \"whitewashing,\" or when white actors are cast in historically nonwhite roles. There was Sony's movie, \"Aloha,\" where white actress Emma Stone played a character who is part Asian and part Hawaiian. Marvel's not-yet-released movie, \"Doctor Strange,\" casts white actress Tilda Swinton as a character from Tibet. Additionally, 2010's \"The Last Airbender\" featured actors who are white in the fantasy movie's tribal South Pole setting.\n\n\"Kubo\" director Travis Knight said that Laika supports people of color, as evidenced by the company's employees, who come from a variety of backgrounds and cultures. In response to the movie, Knight said, \"The critical conversation around diversity is one that Laika cares very deeply about.\"\n\nLalo Alcaraz is a cartoonist, cultural commentator and TV show producer who criticized Hollywood's lack of diversity in its high-profile and decision-making positions.\n\n\"I have seen plenty of animated films in the last decade where the cast is almost always 100-percent Anglo [white] actors, with a token minority actor, if that,\" says Alcaraz. \"It seems that most talking, nonhuman characters somehow always seem to be voiced by white actors.\"\n\n\"Moana\" Helps Change The Trend\n\nIt is clear \"Moana\" shows just how Disney has evolved in its approach to culturally sensitive casting. In 1992, veteran Disney directors John Musker and Ron Clements released \"Aladdin.\" The movie featured mostly white voice actors in the lead roles, but added in Asian-American actress Lea Salonga (of \"Mulan\").\n\nIn 1993, The New York Times reported on how a lyric in \"Aladdin\" mentioned a barbaric act. After receiving criticism from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, Disney changed the lyric.\n\nWith directors Musker and Clements, Disney's 2009 film \"The Princess and the Frog\" starred actors of color, including Anika Noni Rose, Bruno Campos, Keith David and Michael-Leon Woodley. Oprah Winfrey and Terrence Howard, who are black, were also cast.\n\nNow, with \"Moana,\" Musker and Clements help lead the change in the way mainstream American animated movies are cast. It appears that Disney has paved the way for other movies to follow suit and change their casting practices. For example, the animated movie \"Coco,\" which is in production, features a Day of the Dead theme and promises to be as culturally aware as \"Moana.\"\n\nAfter all, if animated films can't find actors of color to voice their characters, what chance does the rest of Hollywood have when the film characters are real people?\n\nMichael Cavna is an American cartoonist and \"Comic Riffs\" columnist for The Washington Post.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "1110L": "Opinion: Disney embraces culturally aware and diverse casting in \"Moana\"\nBy Michael Cavna, Washington Post, adapted by Newsela staff\n08.31.16\n\nAn image from Disney's forthcoming \"Moana.\" Photo: Disney\nWhen Disney's \"Moana\" hits theaters this November, it will feel different to many moviegoers for an unusual reason.

They call it \"whitewashing\" and use \"#CartoonsSoWhite.\"\n\nMANAA Says White Casting Doesn't Make Sense\n\nThe Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) is an advocacy group that criticized Laika for casting only white actors in leading roles. MANAA founding president Guy Aoki says this doesn't make sense. \"Why are white actors playing an entire extended Japanese family?\" Aoki asks.\n\nOthers agree. Gene Luen Yang is a Chinese-American cartoonist who is unhappy with the \"Kubo\" casting. \"There are so many Asian-American actors these days. It makes me wonder why they didn't just go with one of them,\" Yang says.\n\nThe nonanimated movies of Hollywood have also been criticized for hiring white actors in traditionally nonwhite roles. In Sony's movie, \"Aloha,\" white actress Emma Stone played a character who is part Asian and part Hawaiian. A Marvel movie that hasn't been released yet, called \"Doctor Strange,\" casts white actress Tilda Swinton as a character from Tibet. And, the 2010 movie \"The Last Airbender\" was set in the tribal South Pole, yet featured white actors.\n\n\"Kubo\" director Travis Knight said that Laika supports people of color. He cited the company's employees, who come from a variety of backgrounds and cultures, as an example. In response to the movie, Knight said, \"The critical conversation around diversity is one that Laika cares very deeply about.\"\n\nLalo Alcaraz is a well-known cartoonist, cultural commentator and TV show writer and producer.

The company has focused on making sure the voice actors fit the movie's culture.\n\nIn 1992, veteran Disney directors John Musker and Ron Clements released \"Aladdin.\" While the movie featured mostly white voice actors in the lead roles, Asian-American actress Lea Salonga (of \"Mulan\") was also included. In addition, Musker and Clements directed Disney's 2009 film \"The Princess and the Frog.\" The movie cast actors of color, including Oprah Winfrey and Terrence Howard.\n\nNow, with \"Moana,\" Disney has changed the way mainstream American animated movies are cast. It appears that other movies are inspired by Disney. Judging by early signs, the animated movie \"Coco,\" which is in production, features a Day of the Dead theme and promises to be as culturally aware as \"Moana.\" The Day of the Dead is a holiday celebrated in Mexico.\n\nAfter all, if animated films can't find actors of color to voice their characters, what chance does the rest of Hollywood have when the film characters are real people?\n\nMichael Cavna is an American cartoonist and \"Comic Riffs\" columnist for The Washington Post.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: \"#CartoonsSoWhite\"? \"Moana\" points the way for actor diversity\nBy Michael Cavna, Washington Post\n08.31.16\n\nAn image from Disney's forthcoming \"Moana.\" Photo: Disney\nWhen the Disney film \"Moana\" lands this November, it will feel fresh to many moviegoers for an unusual reason: It is a mainstream Hollywood animated film that casts featured voice actors of color who represent the culture being depicted.\n\n\"Moana\" centers on the adventure of a young woman looking for a fabled Pacific island, with demigod Maui in tow. Princess Moana herself is voiced by young Hawaiian native Auli'i Cravalho \u2014 who was discovered after an extensive casting call \u2014 and Maui is voiced by Dwayne Johnson, whose mother is of Samoan descent.\n\nThe voice cast also features several New Zealand\u2013sprung actors who are part Maori: Jemaine Clement (\"Flight of the Conchords\"), Temuera Morrison and Rachel House \u2014 as well as Nicole Scherzinger, who has Hawaiian and Filipino roots.\n\n\"Moana\" will arrive in the wake of complaints that another new American animated film, Laika/Focus Features' \"Kubo and the Two Strings\" (which opened Friday), hired too many white voice actors for its lead roles. The film, which is set in a fantastical version of ancient Japan, centers on a folk tale in which some characters are transformed into animals.\n\n\"Kubo\" features the voices of Oscar winners Matthew McConaughey and Charlize Theron and Oscar nominees Rooney Mara and Ralph Fiennes, with Irish-born teen actor Art Parkinson voicing the title role. In secondary roles are the Japanese-American actors George Takei and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, with the cast also including Minae Noji, Alpha Takahashi and Ken Takemoto, among others.\n\nThe Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA), a watchdog group, has criticized Laika for casting white actors in the roles that receive the most screen time. \"Why are white actors playing an entire extended Japanese family,\" MANAA's founding president, Guy Aoki, says in his criticism.\n\nIn other words, often when it comes to casting leading voices: \"#CartoonsSoWhite.\"\n\nGene Luen Yang, a Chinese-American cartoonist, says that the \"Kubo\" casting certainly is curious.\n\n\"There are so many Asian-American actors these days.

And when I asked Knight this month about the creative diversity behind \"Kubo,\" he pointed to Laika's global multiculturalism represented by its employees.\n\nHollywood at large, of course, has increasingly faced accusations of \"whitewashing\" \u2014 by which white actors are cast in ethnic-specific roles \u2014 with Sony's \"Aloha\" (in which Emma Stone played a character who is part Asian and part Hawaiian), Marvel's forthcoming \"Doctor Strange\" (in which Tilda Swinton plays a character who traditionally has been of Tibetan descent), and 2010's \"The Last Airbender\" (in which some of the featured actors are white in the fantasy's tribal South Pole setting) as recent examples. (Since then, Yang has written for the \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" comic books for Dark Horse Books.)\n\nLalo Alcaraz, the \"La Cucaracha\" cartoonist and cultural commentator, has long criticized Hollywood's lack of diversity, especially in high-profile and decision-making positions.\n\n\"I have seen plenty of animated films in the last decade where the cast is almost always 100-percent Anglo actors, with a token minority actor, if that,\" says Alcaraz, who recently served as a writer/consulting producer on Fox's animated \"Bordertown.\"\n\n\"It seems that most talking nonhuman characters somehow always seem to be voiced by white actors,\" Alcaraz, who is a consultant on Disney/Pixar's forthcoming \"Coco,\" tells The Post's Comic Riffs.\n\nJudging by early signs, \"Coco,\" which includes a Day of the Dead theme, promises to be as culturally aware as \"Moana.\" And in \"Moana,\" in fact, you can detect a through-line in how Disney's approach to culturally sensitive casting has evolved over just the past quarter-century.\n\nIn 1992, veteran Disney directors John Musker and Ron Clements released \"Aladdin,\" featuring mostly white voice actors in the lead roles \u2014 with Lea Salonga, the Asian-American actress who sang in this film and \"Mulan,\" being a notable exception. (It's worth noting: The next year, the New York Times reported on how a lyric in \"Aladdin\" mentioned a barbaric act, and Disney changed it in response to criticism from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.

It also damages food production, at a time when we need to feed more people than ever. Pollution is not just an economic issue, it is also a moral one.\n\nAir pollution can be produced both outdoors and indoors. For the poorest families in many countries, indoor smog from coal- or dung-fired cooking stoves is typically the more serious problem. As the countries become more modern and start to use electricity or motors, and begin to build cities, outdoor air pollution becomes the bigger issue.\n\nCleaner technologies are available, with the potential to improve air quality considerably. But policymakers tend to focus myopically on the costs of action, rather than the costs of inaction. Economic growth and rising energy demand are set to fuel a steady rise in emissions of air pollutants and\u00a0a rapid rise in concentrations of particulate matter (PM), or poisonous air particles. Therefore, this approach is not a good one.\n\nNumber Of Deaths Could Double Or Triple By 2060\n\nA new report was recently released by the OECD, or Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The report estimates that outdoor air pollution will cause 6-9 million unnecessary deaths annually by 2060, as compared\u00a0to three million deaths in 2010. That is equivalent to a person dying every 4-5 seconds. Added together, more than 200 million people will die early in the next 45 years as a result of air pollution.\n\nThere will also be more pollution-related illnesses. New cases of bronchitis in children ages 6 to 12 are forecast to soar to 36 million per year by 2060, from 12 million today. For adults, we predict 10 million new cases per year by 2060, up from 3.5 million today. Children are also being increasingly affected by asthma. All of this will translate into more pollution-related hospital admissions, projected to rise to 11 million in 2060, from 3.6 million in 2010.\n\nThese health problems will be concentrated in densely populated areas with high PM concentrations. Many of the affected areas will be cities in China and India. Mortality is also set to reach high levels in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus region, and other parts of Asia, such as South Korea. In these places, aging populations are exposed to air pollution that poses huge risks for the elderly.\n\nAir Pollution's Dollar Costs Are Huge\n\nThe impact of air pollution is often discussed in dollar terms. By 2060, 3.75 billion working days per year could be lost due to the adverse health effects of dirty air \u2013 what economists call the \u201cdisutility of illness.\u201d Businesses and governments around the world could lose $2.6 trillion every year by 2060 from\u00a0lower worker productivity, higher health spending, and lower crop yields.\n\nMassive as they are, however, the dollar figures do not reflect the true costs of air pollution. Avoidable death from breathing in small particles and toxic gases, and the pain and suffering from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, do not have a market price. Nor does the experience of constantly inhaling foul-smelling air, or forcing your child to wear a face mask just to play outside. These burdens weigh far more heavily on people than any price tag can represent.\n\nNonetheless, the truth remains that policymakers tend to respond more to hard figures than to abstract experiences.

Using well-established techniques, these \u201cwillingness-to-pay\u201d figures were converted into an overall value of avoidable deaths caused by outdoor air pollution. These calculations are illustrated in the OECD\u2019s Mortality Risk Valuation in Environment, Health and Transport Policies, among other reports.\n\nBy that measure, the global cost of deaths caused by outdoor air pollution would reach a staggering $18-25 trillion a year by 2060. Arguably, this is not \u201creal\u201d money, as the costs are not related to any market transactions. But it does reflect the value people put on their very real lives. It also reflects the value they would put on policies that would help to delay their very real deaths.\n\nIt is time for governments to stop fussing about the costs of efforts to limit air pollution and start worrying about the much larger costs of allowing it to continue unchecked.

It also damages the making of food, at a time when we need to feed more people than ever. This is not just a problem for businesses. It is also about doing the right thing.\u00a0\n\nAir pollution can be created both outdoors and indoors. For the poorest families in many countries, indoor pollution can come from cooking stoves. This can be a more serious problem than outdoor pollution in places far from the city. Countries are growing, though. As many of them start to use more technology, outdoor air pollution becomes the bigger problem.\n\nCleaner technologies have been invented. This technology might\u00a0improve air quality quite a bit. Still, governments tend to pay more attention the costs of having to create new energy technologies. They pay less attention to the cost of not doing anything.\n\nMore Pollution Is Likely On The Way\n\nMore and more people need energy. There is also a lot of money in making energy, but many ways to create energy cause pollution. Because of these things, there will likely be a lot more pollution in the future. There might also be more dangerous particles in the air. People need to think about the future.\u00a0\n\nA new report says that by the year 2060, outdoor air pollution will cause as many as 9 million\u00a0deaths per year around the world. In 2010, this number was closer to 3 million deaths caused by pollution. More than 200 million people around the world will die in the next 45 years as a result of air pollution. This may not mean that pollution will hurt them directly. It can cause cancer and other illnesses.\n\nOne type of illness that can be caused by pollution is bronchitis. It is a type of bad cough. Currently, 12 million new children get bronchitis each year. By 2060, this number might jump to 36 million. For adults, we think 10 million people might get bronchitis by 2060, nearly three times more people than today. Children are also being increasingly affected by asthma. All of this will mean more pollution-related hospital admissions, projected to rise to 11 million in 2060, from 3.6 million in 2010.\n\nHealth Problems Most Likely In Highly Populated Areas\n\nThese health problems will have a large affect on areas with a lot of people and high levels of poisonous particles. Many of these areas will be in cities in China and India. People will also see problems in Eastern Europe, parts of the Middle East, and other parts of Asia. In these places, aging populations are exposed to air pollution. This pollution is very dangerous for the elderly.\n\nThe effect of air pollution is often discussed in dollar terms. By 2060, countries will lose a lot of money. These losses will be because the health problems related to air pollution. Lower worker productivity, higher health spending, and lower crop turnout will all cause losses.\n\nThe large dollar figures do not reflect the true costs of air pollution. Pain, suffering, and avoidable death from breathing in toxic air do not have a price. Neither does the experience of having your to wear a face mask just to play outside because the air is so bad. These problems are more important than money.\n\nGovernments Need To Help Their Citizens\n\nUnfortunately, policymakers often care more about numbers. So a government agency looked at money. They tried to\u00a0measure what people's health is worth to them.\n\nBy that measure, the global cost of deaths caused by outdoor air pollution is very large. The number\u00a0reflects the value people put on their health. It also reflects the value they would put on government changes that would help to delay their deaths.\n\nIt is time for governments to stop fussing about the costs of efforts to limit air pollution.

The pollution is from fire ovens. Outdoor air pollution is also becoming a big problem.\n\nBetter Technology Might Be Able To Help\n\nSome pollution is caused by things that create energy. Energy is becoming more and more needed around the world. We need it for cars, for cities and electricity. There is some technology that would lead to less pollution. This technology might\u00a0make the air better.\u00a0\n\nLawmakers often do not care, though. Many times, lawmakers care more about money. Creating new technologies would cost money. These lawmakers should think about the cost pollution will have on the future.\n\nStudy Says Outdoor Air Pollution Is On The Rise\n\nA new study says that outdoor air pollution is getting worse. It will hurt many people by the year 2060. Pollution can cause diseases or illnesses.\n\nThe study says more children and grown-ups could become sick.\u00a0These illnesses will mean that more people will go to the hospital.\n\nThe pollution problems will most hurt places with a lot of people. China and India will likely have a lot of problems.\n\nPeople often try to explain the cost of air pollution. They want to use money to show how bad pollution can be. By 2060, countries will lose a lot of money because of pollution. Air pollution will cause people to miss work. Missed work will mean less money for businesses. It will also make people spend money going to the hospital. \u00a0\n\nSome Lawmakers Care More About Money Than Lost Lives\n\nPeople can become sick from pollution. This is\u00a0more important than money.\u00a0Unfortunately, lawmakers often care more about losing money than about people getting sick.\u00a0\n\nThe government did the math.

Photo: AP Photo/Vincent Yu\nPeople like technology because it makes life easier. It can mean new things or new ways to use things. Still, people sometimes fight new technology.\n\nOne example is the printing press. When it was invented a long time ago, it was a new technology. It helped churches print books and spread their messages. Yet one government did not allow the printing of a church book for nearly 400 years.\n\nMany People Are Afraid Of Change\n\nWhy fight technology? As I say in my book, \"Innovation and Its Enemies: Why People Resist New Technologies,\" the answer is not just that people are afraid of what they do not know. Instead, they are afraid of change. They might lose jobs or money. Governments sometimes decide that it would be easier to keep out the new technology than to use it.\n\nThe government that did not print the church book saved jobs. Some people's job was writing pages for books. Later, the government said other books could be printed. The writers did not like this change because they might not be able to work.\u00a0\n\nSome Say Things That Are Not True\n\nThe government is not always the one fighting change. People who lose jobs sometimes fight technology.\u00a0\n\nThose fighting changes might say things that are not true. English women once said that coffee could make people sick. Later, King Charles II closed coffeehouses. He was probably trying to get people to drink tea instead.\n\nA long time ago, workers were worried about a new food called margarine. They wanted people to keep buying butter. They said that margarine made people sick.\u00a0Workers also said margarine was made with dead animals in it.\n\nThe government then said margarine had to have more rules. People also would have to pay more if they wanted to buy it.\u00a0\n\nPeople Want To Keep Their Jobs Or Money\n\nPeople hardly ever fight changes because they do not understand them. They want to be able to keep their jobs or money.\n\nWe need to understand new technology to accept it. For example, some workers might not have jobs because of machines. We need to help the people who lose jobs. They might not fight new technology. Then we can come up with more new things.\n\nCalestous Juma is a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "1100L": "Opinion: Everyone not on board when it comes to new technologies\nBy Calestous Juma, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n08.22.16\n\nA Chinese worker sits next to orange robot arms at Rapoo Technology factory in the Chinese industrial boomtown of Shenzhen on Aug. 21, 2015.

Photo: AP Photo/Vincent Yu\nTechnological advances are often praised for their power to fuel business growth and move societies forward. Yet breakthroughs often face barriers to wider use. Governments sometimes ban new technologies outright \u2013 even those that could bring far-reaching benefits.\n\nConsider the printing press. Among other things, the new technology gave a boost to world religions, which suddenly had an efficient way to produce and spread sacred texts. Yet the Ottoman Empire forbade the printing of the Muslim holy book the Quran\u00a0for nearly 400 years. In 1515,\u00a0Sultan Selim I is said to have decreed that \u201coccupying oneself with the science of printing was punishable by death.\u201d\n\nWhy oppose such a positive technology? As I argue in my book, \"Innovation and Its Enemies: Why People Resist New Technologies,\" the answer is not simply that people are afraid of the unknown. Rather, resistance to technological progress is usually rooted in the fear that change might bring losses in employment, income and power. Governments often end up deciding that it would be easier to prohibit the new technology than to adapt to it.\n\nOttoman Leaders Sought To Maintain Authority\n\nBy banning the printing of the Quran, Ottoman leaders delayed job losses for calligraphers, many of whom were known for their masterful writing. However, protecting employment was not the leaders' main motivation. After all, they did allow non-religious texts to be printed in 1727, despite protests. The writers protested by putting their ink stands and pencils in coffins and marching together.\n\nReligious knowledge was a different matter. It was both the glue that held society together and a pillar of political power. Maintaining a monopoly over the sharing of that knowledge was critical to maintaining the authority of Ottoman leaders. They feared going the way of the Catholic pope, who lost considerable authority during the Protestant Reformation, when the printing press played a key role in spreading new ideas to the faithful.\n\nOf course, putting up barriers to technological change does not always start with the government. Those who benefit from the current system may push their governments to impose bans. They may do so through protest, as the Ottoman calligraphers did. More recently, Irish opponents of genetically modified potatoes protested in 2002, marching in Dublin to express their opposition to the \u201cdeath of good food.\u201d\n\nResistance Comes In Different Forms\n\nOpponents of new technologies may also use misinformation \u2013 an approach that has worked in the past. In 1674, English women claimed that coffee caused sterility. They said it should be consumed only by people over 60 years old \u2013 a small part of the population at the time. The following year, King Charles II ordered the shutdown of coffeehouses. However, he was probably motivated more by the desire to protect the sales of local drinks, including alcohol and tea, than by the infertility rumors.\n\nIn the 1800s, the American dairy industry spread similar misinformation about margarine. These butter promoters claimed that margarine caused sterility and male baldness.\u00a0They said margarine contained diseased beef, dead horses, dead hogs and mad dogs.\n\nIn response, the federal government introduced restrictions on margarine, covering everything from labeling to the use of artificial coloring. It is similar to the labeling required for\u00a0genetically modified foods today.\u00a0New taxes also promoted butter sales over margarine. In 1886, a Wisconsin congressman said he would stop the manufacture of margarine \"by taxing it out of existence.\u201d\n\nResistance to tractors in the early 1900s took a different form. Producers and traders of animals used for pulling heavy loads feared the advances that came with tractors, which threatened their way of life. However, they knew that they could not improve their work animals quickly enough to compete with tractors' gains. They realized that blocking the spread of tractors would be impossible.\u00a0Instead, they touted the strengths of these farm animals. The Horse Association of America issued pamphlets declaring that, \u201cA mule is the only fool-proof tractor ever built.\u201d The group also noted that horses could produce more horses, while tractors dropped in value over time.\n\nAvoiding Backlash Against New Technology\n\nPeople rarely reject progress out of sheer ignorance. Rather, they fight to protect their own interests, whether that be operating a dairy farm or running a government. As we continually attempt to use advances to improve our well-being, this distinction is vital.\n\nAvoiding barriers to technological progress requires understanding and addressing its downsides. For example, as machines become increasingly capable, robots are replacing a growing number of workers. It will not be long before those robots will be able not only to perform more difficult tasks but also to learn faster than workers can be trained. Just like fewer animals are used to pull heavy loads, it's likely that some workers will be replaced by machines.\n\nHowever, if we recognize these losses and address them head-on, we can avoid a backlash against potentially valuable improvements. We can reduce negative sentiments over advances in technology.

Photo: AP Photo/Vincent Yu\nTechnological innovation is often extolled for its power to overcome major development challenges, fuel economic growth and propel societies forward. Yet innovations frequently face high barriers to implementation, with governments sometimes banning new technologies outright \u2013 even those that could bring far-reaching benefits.\n\nConsider the printing press. Among other things, the new technology was a boon to world religions, which suddenly had an efficient means of reproducing and disseminating sacred texts. Yet the Ottoman Empire forbade the printing of the Koran for nearly 400 years. In 1515, Sultan Selim I is said to have decreed that \u201coccupying oneself with the science of printing was punishable by death.\u201d\n\nWhy oppose such a beneficial technology? As I argue in my book \"Innovation and Its Enemies: Why People Resist New Technologies,\" the answer is not simply that people are afraid of the unknown. Rather, resistance to technological progress is usually rooted in the fear that disruption of the status quo might bring losses in employment, income, power and identity. Governments often end up deciding that it would be easier to prohibit the new technology than to adapt to it.\n\nBy banning the printing of the Koran, Ottoman leaders delayed employment losses for scribes and calligraphers (many of whom were women who were glorified for their mastery of the art). But protecting employment was not their main motivation; after all, beginning in 1727, they did allow non-religious texts to be printed, despite protests by calligraphers, who responded to the edict by putting their inkstands and pencils in coffins and marching to the High Porte in Istanbul.\n\nReligious knowledge was a different matter. It was both the glue that held society together and a pillar of political power, so maintaining a monopoly over the dissemination of that knowledge was critical to maintaining the authority of Ottoman leaders. They feared going the way of the Catholic pope, who lost considerable authority during the Protestant Reformation, when the printing press played a key role in spreading new ideas to the faithful.\n\nOf course, the erection of barriers to technological innovation does not always start with the government. Those with a vested interest in the status quo may push their governments to impose bans. They may do so through protest, as the Ottoman calligraphers did, and as Irish opponents of genetically modified potatoes did in 2002, by marching in Dublin to express their opposition to the \u201cdeath of good food.\u201d\n\nOpponents of new technologies may also employ slander, misinformation and even demonization \u2013 an approach that has certainly succeeded in the past. In 1674, English women issued a petition against coffee, alleging that it caused sterility and thus should be consumed only by people over 60 \u2013 a very small market at the time. The following year, King Charles II ordered the suppression of coffeehouses, though he was probably motivated more by the desire to protect the market share of local beverages, such as alcoholic drinks and then-newly introduced tea, than by the infertility rumors.\n\nIn the 1800s, the American dairy industry spearheaded a similar misinformation campaign about margarine, claiming that it caused sterility, stunted growth and male baldness. Derided as \u201cbull butter,\u201d opponents claimed that margarine contained \u201cdiseased and putrid beef, dead horses, dead hogs, dead dogs, mad dogs and downed sheep.\u201d\n\nIn response, the federal government introduced new restrictions on margarine, covering everything from labeling (as with genetically modified foods today), the use of artificial coloring and interstate movement. New taxes reinforced butter\u2019s primacy further. In 1886, a Wisconsin congressman declared outright his \u201cintent to destroy the manufacture of the noxious compound by taxing it out of existence.\u201d\n\nResistance to tractors in the early 1900s took a slightly different form. Producers and traders of draft animals feared mechanization, which threatened their way of life. But they knew that they could not improve their product faster than engineers could improve theirs, and thus that blocking the spread of tractors would be impossible. Instead, they sought to prevent the displacement of farm animals, by pursuing a campaign touting their virtues. The Horse Association of America issued leaflets declaring that, \u201cA mule is the only fool-proof tractor ever built.\u201d The group also pointed out that horses could reproduce themselves, whereas tractors depreciated.\n\nPeople almost never reject technological progress out of sheer ignorance. Rather, they fight to protect their own interests and livelihoods, whether that be operating a dairy farm or running a government. As we continually attempt to apply new technologies to improve human and environmental well-being, this distinction is vital.\n\nAvoiding barriers to technological progress requires understanding and addressing its downsides. For example, as machines become increasingly capable, robots are replacing a growing number of workers. It will not be long before those robots will be able not only to perform more complex tasks but also to learn faster than workers can be trained. The notion that some workers will not go the way of the draft animal is irrational.\n\nBut if we recognize these losses and address them head-on, we can avoid a backlash against potentially beneficial technological innovations, including advances in robotics. The key will be to focus on \u201cinclusive innovation,\u201d ensuring that those who are likely to lose from the displacement of old technologies are given ample opportunity to benefit from new ones.

Photo: AP Photo/Vincent Yu\nAdvances in technology are often praised for their power to make life easier. However, people and governments sometimes fight advances \u2013 even\u00a0those that could bring benefits.\n\nNew technologies often face opposition.\n\nOne example is the printing press. When it was invented hundreds of years ago, it was a new technology. It helped churches, which suddenly had a good way to produce and spread books. Yet the Ottoman Empire outlawed the printing of the Muslim holy book called the Quran for nearly 400 years. In 1515, Sultan Selim I is said to have announced that taking part in printing \"was punishable by death.\u201d\n\nWhy oppose useful technology? As I argue in my book, \"Innovation and Its Enemies: Why People Resist New Technologies,\" the answer is not simply that people are afraid of the unknown. Rather, fighting technological progress is usually rooted in the fear that change might bring losses of jobs, money and power. Governments often decide that it would be easier to keep out the new technology than to adapt to it.\n\nLeaders Controlled Church Information\n\nBy avoiding the printing of the Quran, Ottoman leaders saved the jobs of artists who wrote text on pages.\u00a0However, keeping jobs\u00a0was not their main concern. In 1727, they did allow other pages to be printed, in spite of protests from writers.\u00a0\n\nReligious knowledge was a different matter. It was the glue that held society together and a pillar of government power. Controlling church information was important to leaders. The Catholic pope lost power during the Protestant Reformation when the printing press made it easier to spread new ideas. Other leaders did not want this to happen to themselves.\n\nFighting technological change does not always start with the government. Those who benefit from the current system may push their governments to oppose advances. They may do so through protest, as the Ottoman writers did. More recently, Irish protesters fought genetically modified potatoes in 2002. They marched in Dublin to oppose the \u201cdeath of good food.\u201d\n\nMisinformation About Coffee And Margarine\n\nThose fighting new technologies may also use misinformation \u2013 which has worked in the past. In 1674, English women claimed that coffee caused health problems. They said only people over the age of 60 should drink it. The following year, King Charles II ordered the closing of coffeehouses. However, he was probably more concerned that coffee would hurt the sale of tea than about the health rumors.\n\nIn the 1800s, American dairy workers spread misinformation about margarine. They did not want margarine to hurt butter sales. They claimed that margarine caused health problems.\u00a0Workers also said margarine contained diseased beef, dead horses, dead hogs and mad dogs.\n\nThe government then put controls on margarine, from labeling to the use of food coloring. It is like the labeling needed for\u00a0genetically modified foods today.\u00a0New taxes also targeted margarine sales. In 1886, a congressman said he would stop the manufacture of margarine by taxing it so much it would no longer be made.\u00a0\n\nHow To Avoid A Fight Against Advances\n\nPeople rarely oppose progress from a lack of knowledge. Rather, they fight to protect their own interests, such as earning money. As we attempt to use advances to improve our world, this difference is important.\n\nAllowing technological progress requires understanding. For example, as machines improve, robots are replacing people. It will not be long before those robots will be able to learn faster than workers can be trained. It's likely that some workers will no longer be needed.\n\nHowever, if we see these job losses coming and address them, we can avoid a fight against advances. We can accept progress in robotics. The key will be to make sure those who lose as a result of new technologies are able to benefit from new ones. Only then can we make the most of human creativity.\n\nCalestous Juma is a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "1230L": "Opinion: New innovations must clear hurdles on way to acceptance\nBy Calestous Juma, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n08.22.16\n\nA Chinese worker sits next to orange robot arms at Rapoo Technology factory in the Chinese industrial boomtown of Shenzhen on Aug. 21, 2015.

In 1674, English women issued a petition against coffee, alleging that it caused sterility and thus should be consumed only by people over 60 years old \u2013 a very small market at the time. The following year, King Charles II ordered the suppression of coffeehouses. However, he was probably motivated more by the desire to protect the market share of local beverages, such as alcoholic drinks and then-newly introduced tea, than by the infertility rumors.\n\nIn the 1800s, the American dairy industry spearheaded a similar misinformation campaign about margarine. These butter proponents claimed that margarine caused sterility, stunted growth and male baldness.\u00a0They claimed that margarine contained diseased and spoiled beef, dead horses, dead hogs and mad dogs.\n\nIn response, the federal government introduced restrictions on margarine, covering everything from labeling, as with genetically modified foods today, to the use of artificial coloring and movement between states. New taxes favored the butter industry over margarine. In 1886, a Wisconsin congressman declared his plan to destroy the manufacture of margarine \"by taxing it out of existence.\u201d\n\nResistance to tractors in the early 1900s took a slightly different form. Producers and traders of animals that pulled heavy loads feared a shift toward machinery, which threatened their way of life. But they knew that they could not improve their product faster than engineers could improve theirs, and thus that blocking the spread of tractors would be impossible. Instead, they pursued a campaign touting the virtues of farm animals. The Horse Association of America issued leaflets declaring that, \u201cA mule is the only fool-proof tractor ever built.\u201d The group also pointed out that horses could reproduce themselves, whereas tractors dropped in value over time.\n\nRecognizing And Addressing The Downsides\n\nPeople almost never reject technological progress out of sheer ignorance.

That is the group in charge of the Olympics.\n\nWhere should the permanent sites be?

Other countries have also spent too much, and the cost of holding the Olympics keeps going up. The 2008 Summer Games in China cost more than $42 billion. In 2014, Russia spent more than $50 billion for the Winter Games.\n\nIn 2020 the Summer Olympics will be in Tokyo.

Countries must compete to hold them, and those that do often spend too much money. This year, Brazil is hosting the Olympics. Brazil does not have a lot of money. Still, the country has spent a lot on the games.\n\nOne idea people have is it to always hold the Olympics in Greece. That's where the Olympics began 3,000 years ago.\u00a0\n\nAnother idea is to build permanent homes for the games. The International Olympic Committee runs the Olympics. It could build Olympic stadiums in a few different countries. Then, the Olympic Games would switch between them.\n\nThe Olympics Improve Countries\n\nBoth ideas are big mistakes, though. The Olympics is a country's chance to show off to the world. It can share the things that make their country special.\u00a0\n\nThe 1964 Olympics was in Tokyo. In 1945, Japan lost to America in World War II. The Tokyo Olympics made Japan feel proud again.\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics also helped rebuild Japan. A high-speed train opened just days before the games started. The games pushed Japan to build a highway system. Japan also improved the subway system.\n\nMaking History Beyond Sports\n\nHosting the Olympics in many different countries can also make history.\n\nIn 1936, the Olympics were held in Berlin, the capital of Germany. German leader Adolf Hitler thought Germans were the best athletes. He did not think blacks should be allowed to compete in the games. He thought the Olympics would prove this.\u00a0\n\nJesse Owens showed Hitler he was wrong. Owens was African-American. He was on the U.S. track and field team, and was the most successful athlete of those games.\n\nThe Olympics belong to the world. Many big cities want to host the Olympics.

That\u2019s why we need to seriously consider permanent sites for the Summer and Winter Games.\n\nDespite Brazil sliding into a self-declared \u201cfinancial calamity,\u201d the Olympics have gone on as scheduled in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nNo matter that a security force of 85,000 was required.\n\nNo matter that Brazil would be better served using public monies on affordable housing and clean water for its citizens rather than constructing costly new sports venues.\n\nNo matter that the final price tag is expected to be upwards of $20 billion.\n\n\u201cWe are in a moment in the world where we need to be reasonable with the way we spend money,\u201d said Fernando Meirelles, the Oscar-nominated director who choreographed the opening ceremonies. \u201cWhen 40 percent of the homes in Brazil have no sanitation, you can\u2019t really be spending (billions) for a show.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a message that the International Olympic Committee needs to hear loud and clear.\n\nThe idea of permanent Olympic sites dates back more than three decades.\n\nIn 1984, F. Don Miller and William Simon of the U.S. Olympic Committee proposed permanent sites \u2014 one each in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa \u2014 with the Olympics alternating between these specific venues.\n\nWhere should the permanent sites be? Why not ask the athletes?\n\nA board of former and current medal winners would know the top existing venues \u2014 perhaps Oslo for track, London or Sydney for swimming.\n\nIt may make sense for Greece, where the Olympics originated more than 3,000 years ago, to be among the permanent sites, too. Such facilities would receive regular upkeep and remain state-of-the-art.\n\nWhat else would such a change accomplish?\n\nFirst, it would end the insane bidding wars to host the games. It would help curtail the bribes and kickbacks that are seemingly required to land an Olympiad. More importantly, it would hold down costs for the host cities.\n\nMontreal in 1976, Athens in 2004 and now Rio mortgaged their citizens\u2019 future for the opportunity to throw a party for rest of the world. Unfortunately, the spending continues to spike. The 2008 Summer Games in Beijing cost more than $42 billion, only to be surpassed by Sochi\u2019s $50 billion price tag for the Winter Games six years later.\n\nCosts will to continue to spiral upward with the impending 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. There, a new stadium\u00a0alone\u00a0will cost $2 billion, exceeding the construction costs of MetLife Stadium and Yankee Stadium in the New York City area and London's Wembley, which serves as England\u2019s national soccer venue, the Associated Press reported.\n\nBy pooling television, signage and advertising revenue, permanent sites could easily become a reality. There would be no need to build new facilities for future Summer or Winter Games.\n\nOf course, the world rarely operates in such a logical, equitable way. But by using permanent sites, the IOC would also have a chance to polish its tarnished image. Fewer upfront costs would mean a better bottom line for everyone and give officials a chance to redirect revenue to developing countries for vaccines or food assistance.\n\nSuch programs, along with goodwill visits by Olympians, would revitalize the image of the games. From the recent doping scandals to the boycotts in 1980 and 1984 to reports of the polluted water in Rio, you would think the powers that be would be eager to clean up their act.\n\nNow\u2019s their chance.\n\nA graduate of Syracuse University, Tim Wendel is the author of 11 books, including \u201cGoing for the Gold\u201d and \u201cSummer of \u201868.\u201d He is the writer in residence at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Washington, D.C. campus.\nCONS: Olympics showcase sport and national pride\nIt would be very wrong to diminish the majesty and international scope of the Olympic Games by, as some are suggesting, anchoring them in Greece or on permanent sites on five continents.\n\nThe seemingly endless problems with this year\u2019s Rio Games have prompted calls to stop having nations compete to host the contests and instead hold them in permanent facilities in North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa.\n\nThis would be a serious mistake. It would deprive nations of a chance to show national pride, make economic gains and, most importantly, make history.\n\nThe Olympics represent the ultimate opportunity to showcase a nation's identity on the global stage.\n\nFor example, the 1964 Tokyo Olympics marked a shining moment in Japan\u2019s history, an occasion that restored national pride after a humiliating World War II defeat and heralded the country\u2019s long, victorious climb toward becoming an international economic power.\n\nThose Olympics helped rebuild the nation\u2019s infrastructure; the bullet train connecting Tokyo and Osaka started operating just days before the games were held that year, and the core of the Metropolitan Expressway, the highway system in central Tokyo, was newly constructed. Tokyo\u2019s public transportation network was given a major boost, while the public broadcasting system was upgraded, encouraging families to purchase color television sets.\n\nIn Great Britain, during the 2012 Olympics, polls showed that a vast majority of British men felt a renewed sense of national pride because their nation was hosting the games. This is invaluable to a nation.\n\nThe Olympics have also made history for reasons larger than the games themselves.\n\nDuring the Berlin 1936 Olympics, Hitler planned to show the world that the Aryan people were the dominant race. Jesse Owens, an African-American, proved him wrong and sealed his place in Olympic history by becoming the most successful athlete of those games.\n\nOwens also became the first American to win four track and field gold medals at a single Olympics, a record that stood for 48 years.\n\nThe fact that Owens did this in, of all places, Berlin added much luster to his achievements. Hitler wouldn\u2019t have been as humiliated if the Olympics had been held anywhere else in the world, including Greece.\n\nAnother year when the world was focused on the Olympics, at least partially because of their location, came in 1956.\u00a0Back then, Australia was an exotic, unknown place for much of the world, which heightened interest in the Melbourne games.\n\nArmed conflict in Hungary threatened to disrupt the 1956 Games because in November, Soviet tanks rolled into that nation to crush a heroic anti-Communist armed revolt by the vastly outnumbered and outgunned Hungarians.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Soviet water polo team met the Hungarians in that obscure sport\u2019s semifinals.\n\nHungary got the world\u2019s attention by winning by 4-0, and the match turned ugly after a Hungarian player was pulled bleeding from the pool with a deep gash over his eye from a Soviet head butt.\n\nA brawl involving players and spectators quickly ensued, and the police had to step in to prevent a riot. But again the brave Hungarians largely prevailed.\n\nThe Olympics belong to the world, not to any single nation. Any major city that wants to foot the bill should be eligible to host them.\n\nWhitt Flora, an independent journalist, covered the White House for The Columbus Dispatch and was chief congressional correspondent for Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "810L": "PRO/CON: A permanent home for the Olympic Games\nBy Tribune News Service, adapted by Newsela staff\n08.18.16\n\nIn this July 2015 photo, the Olympic Park for the 2016 Olympics is under construction in Rio de Janeiro.

It is much too high. That\u2019s why we need to build permanent sites for the Olympic Games. The Olympics could return to these sites instead of building new ones.\n\nBrazil is hosting the 2016 Olympics in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The country has a lot of financial problems. Still, the games have gone on as planned.\u00a0\n\nIt cost millions of dollars to hire\u00a085,000 security officers for the Olympics, and Brazil spent even more on expensive new stadiums. The final cost for the Rio Olympics will probably be more than $20 billion.\n\nIt would have been better for Brazil to spend the money on housing and clean water.\n\nA movie director named Fernando Meirelles helped plan the Olympics' opening ceremony. He said that four out of 10 homes in Brazil have no indoor toilets, so the country shouldn't be spending billions of dollars on a sporting event.\n\nChoosing A Permanent Home\n\nThe International Olympic Committee needs to hear that message. The IOC is the group in charge of the Olympics.\u00a0\n\nThe idea for permanent Olympic sites goes back more than 30 years.\n\nIn 1984, two men on the U.S. Olympic Committee suggested permanent sites. They wanted one site each in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. That would be five sites total. The Olympic Games would switch between them.\n\nWhere should the sites be? Why not ask the athletes?\u00a0Medal winners would know the best places to play their sport.\u00a0\n\nThe Olympics began in Greece more than 3,000 years ago. It may make sense for Greece to have one of the sites, too.\n\nEnding Crazy Competition, And Bribery\n\nBuilding permanent sites would solve many problems. First, it would end the crazy competition to host the games. Second, it would help end bribery. Some leaders have paid money to IOC officials so that their city would be chosen. Most importantly, it would be cheaper for the host cities.\n\nMontreal, Athens and Rio de Janeiro put their futures in danger to host the Olympics. These cities all spent billions of dollars they didn't have. The cost of hosting the Olympics continues to rise. The 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, China, cost more than $42 billion. In 2014, Russia spent more than $50 billion to host the Winter Games in the city of Sochi.\u00a0In 2020, the Summer Olympics will be in Tokyo. One new stadium alone there will cost $2 billion.\u00a0\n\nThe IOC makes money from the Olympics. It could give the money it makes to the permanent sites to keep them up to date, so that new arenas wouldn't be needed for every Olympics.\n\nThere would be more money for everyone this way. IOC officials could even give extra money to poor countries for medicine or food.\n\nThe Olympics have had many scandals in recent years. Athletes have been thrown out of the Olympics for using drugs to make themselves stronger or faster. Now there are reports that the water in Rio is polluted. The IOC should do something to make the Olympics look better.\n\nNow is their chance.\n\nTim Wendel is the author of 11 books, including \u201cGoing for the Gold\u201d about the U.S. Olympic Hockey Team. He is a writer at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Washington, D.C., campus.\nCON: Hosting the Olympics creates national pride\nSome people have suggested holding the Olympic Games in Greece or in permanent places on five continents. That would be very wrong.\n\nThere have been many problems with this year's games. People say there should be a better way to plan the Olympics. Right now, nations compete to host the games, and they spend millions of dollars even before they're chosen. Some think that the games should be held in the same places in North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa, instead.\n\nThis would be a serious mistake. Countries would not get a chance to show their national pride or make important improvements for the games. Most importantly, they would not have a chance to make history.\n\nA Recovery From World War II\n\nFor example, the 1964 Tokyo Olympics was an important moment in Japan\u2019s history. Japan was defeated by America in World War II. The Olympics gave the Japanese a feeling of national pride, and continued the country's climb toward becoming one of the world's most important countries.\n\nThose Olympics helped rebuild Japan. The high-speed train connecting Tokyo and the city of Osaka opened only days before the games. The main part of the highway system in the center of Tokyo was rebuilt, and Tokyo\u2019s subway system was improved.\n\nIn 2012, Great Britain hosted the Olympics. That year, most British men said they felt a sense of pride because their nation was hosting the games. This is very important for a nation.\n\nMaking History Beyond Sports\n\nThe Olympics have also made history for reasons other than the games.\n\nIn 1936, the Olympics were held in Berlin, which was the capital of Nazi Germany. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler planned to show the world that Germans were better than everyone else and should rule the world. Jesse Owens, a black athlete from the U.S., proved him wrong. He was the most successful athlete of those games.\n\nOwens also became the first American to win four track and field gold medals at a single Olympics. His record was not broken for 48 years.\n\nHitler was very embarrassed that Owens beat the Germans in Berlin, their home city.\n\nStanding Up To The Soviet Union\n\nThe 1956 Olympics is another example.\u00a0The games were held in Melbourne, Australia. Back then, the rest of the world did not know much about Australia. Holding the games there made viewers around the world more interested.\n\nThe 1956 Games were almost ruined by a war. That year, the Soviet Union sent tanks into Hungary. It wanted Hungary to follow its communist policies. In a communist system, the government owns all the businesses. Hungarians did not like this system. They revolted.\u00a0\n\nShortly after, the Soviet water polo team competed against the Hungarians.\u00a0Hungary won 4-0. The match was very difficult and even violent, but the Hungarians stayed brave.\n\nThe Olympics belong to the world, not to any single nation. Any major city that wants to pay for the games should be allowed to host them.\n\nWhitt Flora covered the White House for The Columbus Dispatch.

But the Games\u2019 price tag for host nations has soared too high. That\u2019s why we need to consider permanent sites for the Summer and Winter Games.\n\nThough Brazil has been sliding into what it is calling \u201cfinancial calamity,\u201d the Olympics have gone on as scheduled in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nNo matter that a security force of 85,000 soldiers and police officers was required.\n\nNo matter that Brazil would benefit more from using public funds on affordable housing and clean water for its citizens rather than costly new sports facilities.\n\nNo matter that the final price tag is expected to be greater than $20 billion.\n\n\u201cWe are in a moment in the world where we need to be reasonable with the way we spend money,\u201d said Fernando Meirelles, the film director who choreographed the opening ceremonies. \u201cWhen 40 percent of the homes in Brazil have no sanitation, you can\u2019t really be spending (billions) for a show.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a message that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) needs to hear loud and clear.\n\nPicking A Permanent Home\n\nThe idea of permanent Olympic sites dates back more than three decades.\n\nIn 1984, F. Don Miller and William Simon of the U.S. Olympic Committee proposed permanent sites in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa. According to their plan, the Olympics would alternate between them.\n\nWhere should the permanent sites be? Why not ask the athletes?\u00a0A board of former and current medal winners would know the top existing facilities in their sport. Oslo, in Norway, might work for track, and London or Sydney for swimming.\n\nIt may make sense for Greece, where the Olympics originated more than 3,000 years ago, to be among the permanent sites, too. Such facilities would receive regular upkeep to remain state-of-the-art.\n\nWhat else would such a change accomplish?\n\nFirst, it would end the insane bidding wars to host the games, and help put a stop to the bribes that are often involved. More importantly, it would hold down costs for the host cities.\n\nCutting Costs That Keep Rising\n\nMontreal in 1976, Athens in 2004 and now Rio compromised their citizens\u2019 future for the opportunity to throw a party for rest of the world. These cities spent billions of dollars they didn't have. Unfortunately, the spending continues to spike. The 2008 Summer Games in Beijing cost more than $42 billion, and Sochi spent more than $50 billion for the Winter Games in the Russian city six years later.\n\nCosts will to continue to spiral upward with the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, where a new stadium will cost $2 billion alone. That is even higher than the construction costs of MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, Yankee Stadium in New York, and London's Wembley, which serves as England\u2019s national soccer venue.\n\nBy splitting television and advertising revenue between the permanent sites, they could easily become a reality. There would be no need to build new facilities for the next Summer or Winter Games.\n\nOf course, the world rarely operates in such a logical, fair way. But by using permanent sites, the IOC would also have a chance to polish its tarnished image. Fewer upfront costs would mean a better bottom line for everyone. It would also give officials a chance to redirect profits to developing countries for vaccines or food assistance.\n\nSuch programs would revitalize the image of the games. From the recent doping scandals to reports of the polluted water in Rio, you would think those in charge would be eager to clean up their act.\n\nNow\u2019s their chance.\n\nA graduate of Syracuse University, Tim Wendel is the author of 11 books, including \u201cGoing for the Gold\u201d and \u201cSummer of \u201868.\u201d He is the writer in residence at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Washington, D.C. campus\nCON: Hosting the Olympics promotes national pride\nAnchoring the Olympic Games in Greece or in permanent sites on five continents would diminish the majesty and international scope of the games. Doing this would be very wrong.\u00a0\n\nThe seemingly endless problems with this year\u2019s Rio Games have prompted calls for new ways of organizing the games. Instead of having nations compete to host the games, some think they should be held in permanent facilities in North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa.\n\nThis would be a serious mistake. It would deprive countries of a chance to show national pride, boost their economies and, most importantly, make history.\n\nThe Olympics represent the ultimate opportunity to showcase a national identity on the global stage.\n\nCelebrating Recovery From World War II\n\nFor example, the 1964 Tokyo Olympics marked a shining moment in Japan\u2019s history. It restored Japan's national pride after it was defeated in World War II, and it signaled the country\u2019s long, victorious climb toward becoming an international economic power.\n\nThose Olympics helped rebuild the nation\u2019s infrastructure. The bullet train connecting Tokyo and Osaka started operating just days before the Games were held. The core of the Metropolitan Expressway, the highway system in central Tokyo, was newly constructed. Tokyo\u2019s public transportation network was given a major boost, while the public broadcasting system was upgraded, which encouraged families to purchase color television sets.\n\nIn Great Britain during the 2012 Olympics, polls showed that a vast majority of British men felt a renewed sense of national pride because their nation was hosting the Games. This sense of pride is invaluable to a nation.\n\nMaking History Beyond Sports\n\nThe Olympics have also made history for reasons larger than the sports themselves.\n\nDuring the Berlin 1936 Olympics, Nazi leader Adolf Hitler planned to show the world that the Aryan people, meaning whites of Northern European ancestry, were the dominant race. Jesse Owens, an African-American, proved him wrong by becoming the most successful athlete of those games.\n\nOwens also became the first American to win four track and field gold medals at a single Olympics. This record stood for 48 years.\n\nThe fact that Owens did this in Berlin added a layer of meaning to his achievements. Hitler wouldn\u2019t have been as humiliated if the Olympics had taken place somewhere else in the world.\n\nStanding Up To The Soviet Union\n\nAnother case where the world was focused on the Olympics at least in part because of their location came in 1956, in Melbourne, Australia.\u00a0Back then, Australia was an exotic, unknown place for much of the world. This increased interest in the Melbourne games.\n\nArmed conflict in Hungary threatened to disrupt the 1956 Games. In November of that year, tanks from the Soviet Union rolled into that nation to crush an anti-Communist armed revolt by the Hungarians, who were vastly outnumbered and outgunned.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Soviet water polo team met the Hungarians in the semifinals.\u00a0Hungary got the world\u2019s attention by winning 4-0. The match turned ugly after a Hungarian player was pulled bleeding from the pool with a deep gash over his eye, the result of a Soviet head butt.\n\nA brawl involving players and spectators quickly started, and the police had to step in to prevent a riot. But again, the brave Hungarians prevailed.\u00a0\n\nThe Olympics belong to the world, not to any single nation. Any major city that wants to foot the bill should be eligible to host them.\n\nWhitt Flora, an independent journalist, covered the White House for The Columbus Dispatch and was chief congressional correspondent for Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "940L": "PRO/CON: Should the Olympics stay in one place?\nBy Tribune News Service, adapted by Newsela staff\n08.18.16\n\nIn this July 2015 photo, the Olympic Park for the 2016 Olympics is under construction in Rio de Janeiro.

That's where the Olympics started more than 3,000 years ago.\u00a0\n\nWhat would this change accomplish?\n\nFirst, it would end the insane competition to host the games. It would help put a stop to the bribes and corrupt behavior that some cities use to win this bidding war. More importantly, it would allow cities to instead spend money on helping their people.\n\nSaving Cities Billions Of Dollars\n\nMontreal in 1976, Athens in 2004 and now Rio have spent their citizens\u2019 money for the chance to throw a party for rest of the world. These cities spent billions of dollars they didn't have. Unfortunately, the cost to host the games continues to rise. The 2008 Summer Games in Beijing cost more than $42 billion. Six years later, Sochi in Russia spent more than $50 billion for the Winter Games.\n\nCosts will only continue to rise with the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. There, one new stadium will cost $2 billion. That is even higher than the construction costs of Yankee Stadium in New York and MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.\n\nThe IOC gets a lot of money from selling the rights to advertise at the games and to broadcast them on TV. It could give this money to the permanent sites to help them stay up to date. Then, new facilities for the next Summer or Winter Games wouldn't be needed.\n\nOf course, the world doesn't usually operate in such a logical, fair way. But by using permanent sites, the IOC would also have a chance to improve its bad reputation.\u00a0 Fewer costs for facilities would mean more money for everyone. IOC officials could give money to countries in need of medication or food assistance.\n\nSuch programs would help fix the image of the games. The Olympics have been full of scandals in recent years. Athletes have illegally used drugs to be faster or stronger. In Rio, there have been reports of polluted water. The IOC should be eager to do something to make the organization look better.\n\nNow\u2019s their chance.\n\nA graduate of Syracuse University, Tim Wendel is the author of 11 books, including \u201cGoing for the Gold\u201d and \u201cSummer of \u201868.\u201d He is the writer in residence at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Washington, D.C. campus.\nCON: The Olympics allow all people to feel national pride\nIt would be wrong to host the Olympic Games only in Greece, or in permanent sites on five continents.

The United Nations is a group that tries to keep peace between countries.\n\nThe group chose the day to remember four people who were killed in 1952 in Pakistan.\u00a0Pakistan is in Asia, next to India.\u00a0The people were speaking a language called Bengali. They were not allowed to speak that language in Pakistan.\n\nThe U.N. says there is a strong bond between people and language. Language is a human right.\n\nLanguage Makes Us Human\n\nLanguage is what makes us human. We use it to ask for food or water. We can also use it to describe our wildest dreams. We call our first language our \u201cmother language.\" We learn it from our mothers. It is also called our native language.\n\n\n\nLanguages are in danger. They may be forgotten in our lifetime. Some languages have not been heard for as many as 100 years.\n\nOther languages disappeared a few years ago. In some places, only a few people can remember a language. Some Native American people began learning the lost languages of their tribes. This shows that people can bring back lost languages.\n\nOld Languages Are Being Lost\n\nMost people in the world speak only a few languages. Many speak Arabic, Chinese and English. There are 7,000 languages in the world. If we keep losing languages, we may have fewer than 1,000 languages left. Humans are making new languages. Still, we are losing old languages fast.\n\nMany people say that the United States has one language. Some people think everyone speaks English. Most Americans do speak English. Yet, 55,000,000 Americans also use another language in the home.\n\nLanguage Should Be Celebrated\n\n\n\nCelebrating language is fun. Learning languages is like getting to celebrate your birthday. Like your birthday, your language is unique. It is also like celebrating the new year. Every country and culture celebrates the new year. Every culture also has a language.\n\nSo how should we celebrate language? How about asking your neighbor about his or her language? Tell them that they have a cool language. Then you can ask them how to say hello. In Choctaw, a Native American language, it is \"Halito!\" In Ethiopian Amharic, it is \"Teanaste'lle'n!\" In Welsh, you can say \"Bore da!\" We are all neighbors in this world.

I\u2019m sorry to say that the United States isn't planning any celebrations for February 21, which is International Mother Language Day. The United Nations (U.N.) is a group that aims to build peace around the world. The group chose the date to remember four students who were killed in 1952 by police in Pakistan, a country in Southeast Asia. The national language of Pakistan is Urdu, and the students wanted the right to use their own language, Bengali. The Bengalis later won their independence and began the country of Bangladesh.\n\nThe U.N. says this connection between people and their languages is a human right. As a language expert and teacher, I beg you to plan a parade for that day.\n\nLanguage is what makes us human. We use it to explain our basic needs or to describe our wildest dreams. We call it our \u201cmother language,\u201d because we learn it from our mothers. It is our first language or our native language.\n\nLost Languages\n\n\n\nLanguages are in danger and\u00a0may be lost in our lifetime. Some languages haven't been heard for as many as 100 years, while others disappeared a few years ago. In some place, only a few old people remember some words in one of these lost languages. Some Native American people began learning the historic languages of their tribes. From this, we know that other people can bring back these lost languages. That is how strong the bond can be between people and their language.\n\nMost people in the world speak only a few languages, like English or Arabic. There have been as many as 7,000 languages in the world. Talking about this is important. If we keep forgetting languages, we may have fewer than 1,000 languages left to speak. Yes, humans create new languages, but not nearly as fast as we are losing them.\n\nIn many areas of the world, people speak many languages. Children's mothers may speak to them in more than one language. Certainly, these children grow up learning many languages from their families, and they feel comfortable in all of them. Many people say that the United States has one language. Actually, 55,000,000 English-speaking Americans speak another language at home. For this reason, the day should really be called International Mother Languages Day. In many places, children are raised by grandparents, fathers, siblings and aunties. So to include everyone, the day could also be called International Primary Caretakers Languages Day.\n\nLearning From Those We Love\n\nThe name isn't perfect, but mother language shows our bond with languages. We learned to speak them from those we love. This is what the day is about.\n\n\n\nCelebrating language is like getting to celebrate your birthday and a new year at the same time. Like your birthday, your language is unique. Like the new year, which every culture celebrates in its own way, everyone uses language. By celebrating language, we can celebrate the wide variety of people in our nearly 7,000 languages on earth. We can celebrate this bond that all humans share.\n\nSo how should we celebrate something like language? Well, I don't expect a parade just yet, but why not talk to your neighbor about his or her language? Say something like, \"I hear you speaking a really cool language. What is it?\" You can also ask kids at your school how to say hello in their language. In Choctaw, a Native American language, it is \"Halito!\" In Ethiopian Amharic, it is \"Teanaste'lle'n!\" In Welsh, you can say \"Bore da!\" International Mother Language Day goes a long way to accepting each other more completely as neighbors in this world.\n\nMary Linn is curator of cultural and linguistic revitalization at the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: The right to speak whatever language you want is worth celebrating\nBy Mary Linn, Smithsonian.com\n08.18.16\n\nTOP: Shaheed Minar, or Marty's Monument, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, was established to commemorate those killed during the Bengali Language Movement demonstrations of 1952.

The day to celebrate this bond was chosen by the United Nations in 1999 to commemorate four students who were shot and killed in 1952 by Pakistani police for protesting the right to use their own language, Bengali.\n\nThis bond between individuals and their languages, one that if broken is not forgotten for generations, the U.N. recognizes as a human right. As a linguist and a language educator, I beg you to get out the kazoos and plan a parade.\n\nLanguage is what makes us human. With very few exceptions \u2014 severe brain trauma \u2014 no matter our station in life, our intelligence or our society's ability to create sophisticated gadgets, we all use a highly complex communication system to explain our basic needs or to describe our wildest dreams. The phrase \u201cmother language,\u201d which we once described as \u201cmother tongue,\u201d refers to what we are taught at home from birth by our mothers \u2014 our first language or native language.\n\n\n\nLanguages are severely endangered and risk being lost in our lifetime. Some languages haven't been heard for as many as 100 years while some disappeared a few years ago. There may be only a few elderly people who remember the words and hearing conversations in an endangered language. But we know from hard-earned examples of the Myaamia language of the Miami Tribe, and the Wampanoag language, that dedicated individuals and families, and then communities, can bring back silent languages. That is how strong the language bond can be.\n\nNearly 96 percent of languages are spoken by less than 4 percent of the population. Losing language diversity \u2014 there have been as many as 7,000 languages in the world \u2014 is timely and urgent. If we keep losing languages at the rate we are today, we may have fewer than 1,000 languages left to speak of (linguists love puns!). Yes, humans create new languages, but not nearly at the rate we are losing them today. Surely, this affects us all in ways that we don't even know yet.\n\nIn many areas of the world, households are not just bilingual, but multilingual. Children's mothers may speak to them in more than one language, and certainly these children grow up hearing from infancy multiple languages from their extended families. Multilingual people feel equally comfortable in all of these languages, although from an early age they figure out who is more comfortable in which language, and in what situation, and adapt effortlessly. For them, declaring a first language is rather like asking which color you saw first. The choice is most often made on the father's town's language, or the one that they feel most familiar with, or which is politically safer. Even in the U.S., often defined as a monolingual society, 55,000,000 English-speaking Americans use another language in the home. For this reason, the day should also recognize multilingualism and more properly be called International Mother Languages Day. In modern and traditional societies alike, children are often raised by grandparents, fathers, siblings, aunties, even two mothers. So to be inclusive, the day could also be called International Primary Caretakers Languages Day. Despite the term's deficiencies, mother language does capture the bond that we have with the languages we learned to speak from those we love. The bond between humans and language, this is what the day is about.\n\n\n\nCelebrating language is like getting to celebrate your birthday (uniqueness) and a new year (every culture recognizes this passage whether it is lunar-based, harvest-based or historically based) at the same time. We can celebrate the diversity of human expression and creativeness in what makes up our nearly 7,000 languages on earth, and we can celebrate this bond that as humans we all share.\n\nSo how should we celebrate something as intangible as language? Well, I don't expect a kazoo parade just yet, but why not talk to your neighbor about his or her language as a start? Say something like: \"I hear you speaking a really cool language. What is it?\" Or, ask your colleagues at work how to greet them in their language. Choctaw \"Halito!\" or Ethiopian Amharic \"Teanaste'lle'n\" or Welsh \"Bore da!\" The day goes a long way to accepting each other more completely as neighbors in this world.\n\nMary Linn is curator of cultural and linguistic revitalization at the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "1070L": "Opinion: A day to honor the bond between humans and language\nBy Mary Linn, Smithsonian.com, adapted by Newsela staff\n08.18.16\n\nTOP: Shaheed Minar, or Marty's Monument, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, was established to commemorate those killed during the Bengali Language Movement demonstrations of 1952.

I\u2019m sorry to report that no parades, concerts or speeches are planned in the United States for February 21. The date marks International Mother Language Day. It was chosen by the United Nations (U.N.) in 1999 to remember four students who were shot and killed in 1952 by Pakistani police for protesting the right to use their own language, Bengali. The official language of Pakistan is Urdu. The students wanted Bengali to be one of the official languages of Pakistan and be used in government, education and the media. The Bengalis later won their independence and formed the country of Bangladesh.\n\nThe U.N. recognizes this bond between individuals and their languages as a human right. As a language expert and educator, I beg you to plan a parade.\n\nLanguage is what makes us human. With very few exceptions, we all use it to explain our basic needs or to describe our wildest dreams. The phrase \u201cmother language\u201d refers to what we are taught at home from birth by our mothers, and is our first language or native language.\n\nSome Languages Are Becoming Extinct\n\n\n\nLanguages are severely endangered and risk being lost in our lifetime. Some languages have not been heard for as many as 100 years while some disappeared a few years ago. There may be only a few elderly people who remember the words and hearing conversations in an endangered language. But we know from the Myaamia language of the Miami Tribe, and the Wampanoag language - both Native American languages - that dedicated individuals, families and communities can bring back these languages. That is how strong the language bond can be.\n\nNearly 96 percent of languages are spoken by less than 4 percent of the population. There have been as many as 7,000 languages in the world. International Mother Language Day is timely and urgent, because if we keep losing languages at the rate we are today, we may have fewer than 1,000 languages left. Yes, humans create new languages, but not nearly as fast as we are losing them today, and this affects us all in ways that we don't even know yet.\n\nMultilingualism Should Also Be Recognized\n\nIn many areas of the world, families are not just bilingual, but multilingual. A child's mother may speak in more than one language. Certainly, these children grow up hearing many languages from their families. Multilingual people feel equally comfortable in all of these languages, so for them choosing a first language is rather like asking which color you saw first. The choice is most often the language where they live or the one that they feel most familiar with or which is safer. The United States is often called a monolingual society, although 55,000,000 English-speaking Americans use another language in the home. For this reason, the day should also recognize multilingualism and more properly be called International Mother Languages Day. In modern and traditional societies alike, children are often raised by grandparents, fathers, siblings, aunties, even two mothers. So to include everyone, the day could also be called International Primary Caretakers Languages Day. Even though the name isn't perfect, mother language does show the bond that we have with the languages we learned to speak from those we love. The bond between humans and language, this is what the day is about.\n\nLanguage Deserves To Be Celebrated\n\n\n\nCelebrating language is like getting to celebrate your birthday and a new year at the same time. It is like your birthday because it is unique and like the new year in that every culture uses language and celebrates a new year. By celebrating language, we can celebrate the wide variety of human expression and creativity in our nearly 7,000 languages on earth, and we can celebrate this bond that as humans we all share.\n\nSo how should we celebrate something like language? Well, I don't expect a parade just yet, but why not talk to your neighbor about his or her language as a start? Say something like, \"I hear you speaking a really cool language. What is it?\" You can also ask kids in your class how to greet them in their language. Choctaw \"Halito!\" or Ethiopian Amharic \"Teanaste'lle'n!\" or Welsh \"Bore da!\" International Mother Language Day goes a long way to accepting each other more completely as neighbors in this world.\n\nMary Linn is curator of cultural and linguistic revitalization at the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "950L": "Opinion: Mother Language Day deserves more recognition\nBy Mary Linn, Smithsonian.com, adapted by Newsela staff\n08.18.16\n\nTOP: Shaheed Minar, or Marty's Monument, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, was established to commemorate those killed during the Bengali Language Movement demonstrations of 1952.

A \"mother language\" is the first language that someone learned to speak.

The students wanted Bengali to be one of the official languages of Pakistan and be used in government, education and the media.

As a language expert and educator, I beg you to plan a parade.\n\nLanguage is what makes us human. Almost all of us use it to explain our basic needs or to describe our wildest dreams.\n\nSome Languages Are Disappearing\n\n\n\nLanguages are in danger and\u00a0may be lost in our lifetime. Some languages haven't been heard for as many as 100 years while others disappeared a few years ago. There may be only a few old people who remember the words in an endangered language. Some Native American people, families and communities began learning their native languages, and so we know that people can bring back lost languages. That is how strong the language bond between people and languages can be.\n\nOnly a small number of people speak the most popular languages, like English or Arabic. There have been as many as 7,000 languages in the world. Talking about this is important. If we keep losing languages at the rate we are today, we may have fewer than 1,000 languages left to speak. Yes, humans create new languages, but not nearly as fast as we are losing them. Surely, this affects us all in ways that we don't even know yet.\n\nMultilingual Means Speaking Several Languages\n\nIn many areas of the world, homes are not just bilingual, speaking in two languages, but multilingual. A child's mother may speak in more than one language. Certainly these children grow up hearing many languages from their families. Multilingual people speak several languages and feel just as comfortable in all of them. The United States is often called a single-language society, although 55,000,000 English-speaking Americans use another language in the home. For this reason, the day should really be called International Mother Languages Day. In modern and traditional societies, children are often raised by grandparents, fathers, siblings and aunties, and so to include everyone, the day could also be called International Primary Caretakers Languages Day. Even though the name isn't perfect, mother language describes our bond with the languages we learned from those we love. The bond between humans and language is what the day is about.\n\nLet's Celebrate!\n\n\n\nCelebrating language is like getting to celebrate your birthday and the new year at the same time. It is like your birthday because it is celebrating something unique. It is like celebrating the new year, because just like every culture celebrates the new year, every culture has language. By celebrating language, we can celebrate the wide variety of\u00a0human expression and creativity in our nearly 7,000 languages on earth. We can celebrate this bond that as humans we all share.\n\nSo how should we celebrate something like language? Well, I don't expect a parade just yet, but why not talk to your neighbor about his or her language as a start? Say something like, \"I hear you speaking a really cool language. What is it?\" You can also ask kids in your school how to greet them in their language. In Choctaw, it is \"Halito!\" In Ethiopian Amharic, it is \"Teanaste'lle'n!\" In Welsh, you can say \"Bore da!\" International Mother Language Day goes a long way to accepting each other more completely as neighbors in this world.\n\nMary Linn is curator of cultural and linguistic revitalization at the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In"}, {"820L": "Opinion: Olympics bring attention to adoption issues, family\nBy Jenn Morson, Washington Post, adapted by Newsela staff\n08.16.16\n\nSimone Biles of the United States competes on the balance beam during the Artistic Gymnastics Women's Team Final on Day 4 of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games at the Rio Olympic Arena on August 9, 2016, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Yet, I see Simone forced to explain that while Ron and Nellie are biologically her grandparents, they are truly her mother and father. They changed her diapers and didn't sleep when she was sick.

She kindly clarifies that while Shanon is biologically her mother, Nellie is mom.\n\n\"There Was No Difference\"\n\nThese questions are all too painfully familiar for me. I, too, was raised by parents who did not give birth to me. When I was 3 years old, my biological mother died suddenly and my siblings and I were raised by our aunt and uncle. From the moment I arrived, I was their daughter. There was no difference between the three children my mother delivered in a hospital or those who were delivered to her door.\n\nStill, there were people who could not understand. I overheard the questions directed at my mother. \"So which ones aren't really yours?\" \"Do you think you'll keep them?\" I heard, \"You are just so selfless to take them in!\" as if we were rain-soaked kittens found on the side of the road.\n\nAs I grew older, the questions came my way. People would ask why I wasn't blonde and blue-eyed like my older sister. \"Oh! So you're not really sisters. I get it,\" people would say.\n\nWe are not really sisters. She is not really my mother. He is not really my father. They are not really my family.\n\nAdoption Is Confusing For Some People\n\nNow, I have the confidence to address the questions myself. When a neighbor asked which of the six of us were truly siblings, I said that we all were. Our blood does not determine us as siblings. An older woman at church kept asking me about my aunt and I had a little fun pretending I had no idea what she meant, fully knowing that she was talking about my mom. Although she was my aunt when I was born, my mother has been my mom for 10 times longer.\n\nWhy is it so difficult for people to understand my family and Simone's family? What makes adoption so confusing? It is not a rare event. Babies have been raised by others who are not their biological parents for centuries. Each year in the United States, about 135,000 children are adopted.\n\nLove Of A Family\n\nThere are even physical qualities I've inherited from my parents. My sense of humor is most definitely from my mother, and I don't think my DNA gave me my father's love of old treasures. Many people exclaim that my children look just like their grandmother even though she is not a blood-relative.\u00a0While looking like the people we are related to is nice, it does not decide the love of family.\n\nSo to Mr. Trautwig and others like him, ask yourself, what ties you to your parents or to your children? Is it that you look alike and share the same DNA?\u00a0\n\nOr instead, is it the time your heart was shattered and your father hugged you tightly? This is what makes us sons and daughters. This is what makes us real.\n\nJenn Morson is a writer from the suburbs of Annapolis, Maryland.

They adopted Simone, her brothers, and sister and raised them as their own children.\u00a0\n\nSimone's parents seem like lovely people who always support her. They seem like people who drive far away for her practices. They are people who give things up so she can have her gymnastic dream. They meet her at the hospital after a bad fall.\n\nThese are things that parents do. Yet, Simone is forced to explain that while Ron and Nellie are her grandparents, they feel like her mom and dad. They changed her diapers. They stayed up late when she was sick. They looked at her grades and quizzed her on math. Still, people keep asking Simone about her mother, Shanon. She kindly says that Shanon gave birth to her. Still, she sees Nellie as her real mom.\n\nPeople Don't Understand\n\nI am used to these hurtful questions, too.

When I was born, my mother was my aunt, but she has been my mom for 10 times longer.\u00a0\n\nThere are even traits I got from my parents. I am funny and smart because of my mother. I also got my father's love of old treasures. People say that my children look like their grandmother, but they do not actually share any blood with her. It is nice to have things in common, but they do not have to do with the love of a family.\n\nSo, ask yourself, what ties you to your family?\n\nIsn't it your father's bear hugs? Isn't it your mother's smiling face when she picks you up from school? Those things are what make parents. They make us sons and daughters.

Trautwig clearly did not consider them to be her parents, but has since deleted his tweet, and he's now apologizing for it.\n\nWhen Olympic gymnast Simone Biles speaks of her mother and father who raised her, people recognize that they seem like lovely people who have supported her career from the beginning. The type of people who drive any matter of distances at the crack of dawn to get their daughter to practices. The kind of people who make the financial sacrifices so their child can fulfill her dream of becoming a gymnast. People who can remember precisely which pair of jeans they were wearing when they got the call to meet their child at the emergency room following an injury, or what dinner was left to burn on the stove when they were called to pick up their child from summer camp where she caught a bad case of the chicken pox.\n\nThat's what parents do. And yet watching interview after interview, I see this young woman forced to answer reporters that while Ron and Nellie are biologically her grandparents, they are truly her mother and father. They changed her diapers. They didn't sleep as they kept watch over her fevers. They signed the report cards and permission slips and quizzed her on her math facts and spelling words. For some reason, reporters insist on reminding Simone that her mother's name is Shanon. Ever the diplomat, she kindly corrects the error and clarifies that while Shanon is biologically her mother, Nellie is mom.\n\nAlthough I have yet to win any championships (and my mother would insist I include the word yet), I've not had to answer these questions on the world stage. However, they are all too painfully familiar. Much like Simone and her sister, tragic circumstances led to my being raised by parents who did not give birth to me. When I was 3 years old, my biological mother died suddenly. I was raised, along with my brothers, by our aunt and uncle. From the moment I arrived, I was their daughter, no modifiers necessary. In our home, there was no difference between the three children my mother delivered in a hospital or those who were delivered to her door with tiny suitcases.\n\nDespite the tone my parents worked to set, there were people around us who could not, or maybe would not, understand. At first, I overheard the meddling interrogations directed at my mother, which included but were not limited to, \"So which ones aren't really yours?\" \"Do you think you'll keep them?\" And, of course, \"You are just so selfless to take them in!\" as if we were rain-soaked kittens that had been discovered in a cardboard box on the side of the road.\n\nAnd as I grew older, people felt empowered to direct their comments and questions my way. Mostly out of curiosity, although no less painful, people would ask me why I wasn't blonde and blue-eyed like my beautiful older sister. \"Oh! So you're not really sisters. I get it,\" would come the reply.\n\nNot really sisters. Not really my mother. Not really my father. Not really my family.\n\nNow an adult, I have the confidence to address the ignorance head on, striving to do so kindly, yet firmly. To the co-worker who prattled on and on about how blessed I was to have been rescued by my sainted parents, I assured her that while I was grateful now, just like any other child, I had given my mother at least 25 percent of her gray hairs during my teen years. When a neighbor pressed for clarification on which of the six of us were truly siblings, I gently reiterated that we all were and that DNA was not the defining characteristic of our relationships. And when I ran into the elderly woman at church who kept asking me about my aunt, I may have had a little fun pretending I had no idea what she meant, fully knowing of course that she was referring to my mom. As I watched her shuffle away, perhaps wondering if her memory was failing her, I felt a twinge of guilt, but only the tiniest bit. To be honest, at first I sincerely was confused and paused for a beat, trying to sort out how she might know my aunt who lives several hours away. Because, although when I was born she may have been my aunt, my mother has been my mom for more than 10 times as long as she was my aunt.\n\nIn a world that embraces the notion that it takes a village to raise a child, why is it so difficult for people to understand my family and Simone's family? Setting aside the idea that it isn't anyone's business for the moment, what makes adoption so confusing? It is not a rare occurrence. Since (at least) biblical times, when Moses' mother floated him in a basket, babies have been raised by others who aren't necessarily their biological parents. Each year in the United States, about 135,000 children are adopted.\n\nI understand that biology is fascinating and not easily dismissed. Admittedly, I delight in recognizing certain physical characteristics I have passed on to my own children. When I finally had a brown-eyed girl, I was thrilled. Although a nice bonus, it did nothing to diminish my love for my three blue-eyed children, however. And much like married people can grow to look like one another after years of sharing a life, there are physical manifestations of my relationship with my parents, however non-biological it may be. My quick wit is most definitely inherited from my mother, and I don't think genetic material was necessary for my father to gift me with his love of antiques. I can't begin to tell you how many people exclaim that my children look just like their grandmother. Their grandmother with whom they have no biological connection. And while all of these are lovely, certainly, they aren't necessary for defining the love of family.\n\nSo to Mr. Trautwig and all of those who see my family, or more widely, see Simone Biles' family, and instead of seeing love see only technicalities, look again. Ask yourself, what tethers you to your own parents or to your own children? Is it a shared recessive gene that caused you to both have green eyes? Do you immediately think of the fact that you are both blood type B negative?\n\nRather, isn't it the time your heart was shattered and your father hugged you tightly and let you cry on his shoulder? Isn't it the moment you let go of the back of the bicycle and your daughter soared away from you, squealing with delight because you gave her the confidence she needed? That is what makes us parents. What makes us sons and daughters. That is what makes us real.\n\nJenn Morson is a writer from the suburbs of Annapolis, Maryland.

Photo: AP Photo/Elaine Thompson\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Anyone watching the United States\u2019 presidential race needs to understand the national opinion polls. They do not provide an accurate picture of how the election might turn out. Thanks to America\u2019s Electoral College, it\u2019s not who wins the most votes nationwide that matters in the end, but who wins in which states.\n\nEach state is awarded a certain number of votes in the Electoral College, depending on the size of its population. The candidate who crosses the threshold of 270 electoral votes wins the presidency.\n\nIn almost every state, a candidate who wins 50.1 percent of the popular vote is awarded 100 percent of its electoral votes. (Only Maine and Nebraska don\u2019t follow the winner-take-all rule; they divide the Electoral College vote by congressional district.) As a result, the votes of millions of people who cast their ballot end up not counting. If you\u2019re a Republican in New York or California, which are dominated by the Democrats,\u00a0you can forget about your vote for president mattering. The same is true for a Democrat in Wyoming or Mississippi, which are reliably Republican.\n\nThe Electoral College Explained\n\nOne peculiar result of this peculiar system is that a candidate can win a majority of the national popular vote but lose in the Electoral College, by losing narrowly in highly populated states and winning in some smaller states. It doesn\u2019t happen often. Whenever it does, the U.S. goes through a fit over this seemingly undemocratic process. In the most recent case, Al Gore won a majority of the popular vote in 2000, but George W. Bush won the presidency.\n\nDue to the Electoral College, voters cast their ballots not for a candidate but for a slate of electors \u2013 party activists, including friends and allies of the contender \u2013 who will support their choice. The role of the electors is a brief formality. They meet in their state capitol and cast the vote. But we already know how it\u2019s going to turn out, because the presidential election results are reported at the time in terms of who won each state.\n\nAt this point, the national vote count is meaningless. Congress convenes and \u201ccounts\u201d the electoral votes; but this, too, is a mere formality. The Bush-Gore contest was unusual in that it wasn\u2019t settled until December 12, more than a month after the election, when the Supreme Court, in a highly controversial decision along party lines, voted 5-4 to end the recount in Florida, handing the presidency to Bush.\n\nOne Vote For Each State\n\nNow, here\u2019s where it can get convoluted, and possibilities for mischief arise. If no one wins 270 Electoral College votes, the election goes to the House of Representatives. Each state delegation casts a single vote, regardless of how many voters the delegation represents. Wyoming (population 585,000) and California (population 39,000,000) each get one vote. And the delegations aren\u2019t bound to vote for the candidate who won the most votes in their state.\n\nThen, after the House elects the president, the Senate picks the vice president, with each senator getting one vote. It\u2019s theoretically possible that Congress could elect a president and vice president from different parties.\n\nThis convoluted system for choosing the president reflects the doubt America\u2019s founders had about popular democracy. They were suspicious of the public having its way on the basis of misinformation or a lack of understanding of the issues. The United Kingdom\u2019s vote in June to leave the European Union \u2013 against the advice of experts and allies \u2013 appears to validate this concern.\n\nFounding Fathers Didn't Trust The Public\n\nFrom the outset, America\u2019s founders were aware of the dangers of government by plebiscite. Alexander Hamilton worried about giving power to the people because \u201cthey seldom judge or determine right.\u201d Fearing \u201can excess of democracy,\u201d they interposed institutional cushions between the popular will and government decisions. Until 1913, senators were chosen by the state governments, not directly elected by the voters. And they gave us the Electoral College.\n\nThis system has an enormous impact on the actual campaign for the presidency, because it determines where the candidates spend their time and money. Only about 10 states are considered \u201cswing\u201d states that could go for either party; the rest are considered \u201csafe\u201d states for one party or the other.\n\nSwing States Matter The Most\n\nOf course, sometimes the political wisdom can be wrong and a state bounces out of its party. But these 10 \u201cbattleground\u201d states are the ones to watch for clues as to how the election will turn out. They are much more indicative of the final result than national polls.\n\nFor example, California and New York are so routinely Democratic that the only reason candidates turn up in either one is to raise money. By contrast, Ohio \u2013 the jewel in the crown of swing states, because tradition has it that no Republican can win the presidency without winning there \u2013 is well trodden by the candidates. The other states considered most important to victory for either side are Florida and Pennsylvania.\n\nBecause such highly populated states, along with a handful of others, routinely go Democratic, the Democrats have a built-in advantage in the Electoral College. So Donald Trump is widely believed to have more limited options for accumulating 270 votes.\n\nMaybe the Electoral College isn\u2019t such a peculiar idea, after all.\n\nElizabeth Drew is a regular contributor to The New York Review of Books and the author, most recently, of \"Washington Journal: Reporting Watergate and Richard Nixon's Downfall.\"\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "610L": "Opinion: How the voting system in America works\nBy Elizabeth Drew, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n08.11.16\n\nMembers of Washington state's Electoral College are instructed on the paperwork in casting their votes Dec. 17, 2012, in Olympia, Washington.

It is not who wins the most votes that matters. The more important thing is which states a person wins in.\n\nEach state gets a certain number of votes. The number is based on how many people live there. For example,\u00a0Wyoming has 585,000 people so it gets three votes. California has 39,000,000 people. It gets 55 votes.\u00a0The person who gets 270 state votes wins the presidency.\n\nWinner-Take-All Rule\n\nIf more people in a state vote for one person, then that person wins all of the state's votes. Let us look at California. Suppose 20,000,000 people vote for Hillary Clinton and 19,000,000 vote for Donald Trump. Clinton will get all of California's 55 votes. Trump will get zero.\u00a0\n\nOnly Maine and Nebraska don\u2019t follow this winner-take-all rule.\u00a0\n\nThere is some trouble with doing things this way. A person can win the people's vote but still not be the president. It is because they didn't get enough of the states' votes. It does not happen often.\n\nSwing States\n\nOnly about 10 states are considered \u201cswing\u201d states. This means their votes could go to either party. The two parties are the Democrats and the Republicans. The other states are \u201csafe\u201d states. They almost always go to the same party.\u00a0For example, California and New York are almost always Democratic. Oklahoma and Tennessee are normally Republican.\n\nThe swing states are the ones to watch. They will give an idea of who will win for president.\u00a0Ohio is the jewel of the swing states. In the past, no Republican has won for president without winning there. Other swing states are Florida and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Democrats have a better chance of winning for president with this way of voting. States with a lot of people usually go Democratic. So it might be harder for Donald Trump to get 270 votes.\n\nVoting this way shows how America\u2019s founding fathers thought. They did not fully trust people to make good choices. They were afraid people would vote without the correct facts or understanding.\n\nElizabeth Drew is a regular contributor to The New York Review of Books and the author, most recently, of \"Washington Journal: Reporting Watergate and Richard Nixon's Downfall.\"\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: Understanding America\u2019s Electoral College\nBy Elizabeth Drew, Project Syndicate\n08.11.16\n\nMembers of Washington state's Electoral College are instructed on the paperwork in casting their votes Dec. 17, 2012, in Olympia, Washington.

That was certainly the case at the end of last month, when the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union and its prime minister, David Cameron, announced his resignation. In response, Britain and Europe, not to mention global markets, were thrown into chaos.\n\nWhen it comes to education, by contrast, a week can be the blink of an eye. Change happens over years, if not decades \u2013 and perhaps not even then. But if successful, the establishment of a well-functioning education system can change the face of a country and redefine its fate.\n\nPoor political leadership worldwide is inciting new dangers. In response, Dani Rodrik, Nina Khrushcheva, Kemal Dervis and other Project Syndicate contributors have been asking whether there\u2019s a way back that leads forward.\n\nThat is what happened in my country, Tanzania. From 2000 to 2009, primary-school enrollment rates in Tanzania more than doubled. These schools\u00a0went from just over four million pupils to 8.5 million, or 96 percent of all primary-school-age children. In other words, Tanzania now boasts near-full enrollment at the primary level.\n\nIt Started With The Leaders\n\nSimilar progress can be seen at the secondary level. Over the same nine-year period, the number of secondary schools in Tanzania more than quadrupled, from 927 to 4,102. Enrollment also surged, from just over 250,000 students to nearly 1.5 million.\n\nWhat changed? In short, Tanzania\u2019s leaders, including me, recognized the vital importance of a strong education system, and we committed ourselves to building one.\n\nOf course, few would argue that education is not important. Often, governments are working to provide tangible basic necessities, such as ensuring that citizens have reliable access to clean drinking water or road links to markets and hospitals. In these cases, educational reform can fall by the wayside. But given education\u2019s unmatched potential to improve a country\u2019s prospects, this is a mistake.\n\nMore Schools, Better Schools\n\nIt is this understanding that compelled me, as president of Tanzania, to make education my No. 1 priority. It was not an easy decision. I knew that some people would disagree with this approach. Many would have preferred to distribute more of Tanzania\u2019s limited public budget to building wider highways or taller government buildings, or to expanding the military.\n\nBut I also knew that investing in education meant investing in my country\u2019s future, so I decided that rather than sinking a great deal of money into these other areas, we would commit 20 percent of the annual budget to education. Those funds were applied not just to building more schools but also to building better schools, through investment in teachers, books and technology. After all, simply enrolling more kids would mean little if they were not given all the tools they needed to succeed.\n\nTanzania can serve as a useful model for other countries seeking to upgrade their education systems. But although we achieved success on a limited budget, the challenge that limited finances can pose should not be underestimated. This is especially true for the low- and middle-income countries, often in Africa, that face the biggest educational challenges today.\n\nBenefits Beyond Borders\n\nAs a member of the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity, I have seen firsthand how often governments\u2019 desire to move education up their list of priorities is thwarted by fear of budgetary shortfalls and domestic pressure. As a result, their promises to achieve universal primary education are consistently deferred.\n\nWhen a government commits to improving education, it is betting that equipping its citizens for an unknowable future will yield broad-based, society-wide progress. This is good not only for the country itself but also for its neighbors, for which a more stable and prosperous neighborhood can only be beneficial. In fact, given the interconnectedness of today\u2019s global economy, better education in one country can bring benefits far beyond regional borders.\n\nClearly, the international community has an interest in supporting any government that makes the ostensibly obvious, yet practically difficult, decision to place education at the forefront of its agenda. Thanks to the visionary leadership of Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, this will be a central theme at the next financing commission summit in Oslo.\n\nTanzania\u2019s experience proves that transforming a country\u2019s education system is possible, even if that country faces severe financial limitations. It is not quick or easy. It often requires difficult trade-offs. But with a strong and sustained commitment to fulfill the promise of universal primary and secondary education \u2013 and a little international support \u2013 governments can ensure happier, more prosperous lives for their countries\u2019 young people. One hopes that Tanzania is the first in a wave of countries putting education first.\n\nJakaya Kikwete was the fourth president of Tanzania, serving from 2005 to 2015.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: How to transform an education system\nBy Jakaya Kiwete, Project Syndicate\n08.01.16\n\nA student looks over a biology exercise to prepare for a critical national exam at Msaranga Secondary School outside Moshi, Tanzania, July 29, 2010.

In other words, at the primary level, Tanzania now boasts near-full enrollment.\n\nSimilar progress can be seen at the secondary level. Indeed, over the same nine-year period, the number of secondary schools in Tanzania more than quadrupled, from 927 to 4,102, and enrollment surged, from just over 250,000 students to nearly 1.5 million.\n\nWhat changed? In short, Tanzania\u2019s leaders, including me, recognized the vital importance of a strong education system \u2013 and we committed ourselves to building one.\n\nOf course, few would argue that education is not important. But, when governments are working to provide more tangible basic necessities \u2013 say, ensuring that citizens have reliable access to clean drinking water or road links to markets and hospitals \u2013 educational reform can often fall by the wayside. Given education\u2019s unmatched potential to enhance a country\u2019s prospects, this is a mistake.\n\nIt is this understanding that impelled me, as president of Tanzania, to make education my No. 1 priority. It was not an easy decision. I knew that some people would disagree with this approach, preferring to allocate more of Tanzania\u2019s limited public budget to building wider highways or taller government buildings, or to expanding the military.\n\nBut I also knew that investing in education meant investing in my country\u2019s future, so I decided that rather than sinking a great deal of money, sometimes unproductively, into these other areas, we would commit 20 percent of the annual budget to education. Those funds were applied not just to building more schools but also to building better schools, through investment in teachers, books and technology. After all, simply enrolling more kids would mean little if they were not given all the tools they needed to succeed.\n\nTanzania can serve as a useful model for other countries seeking to upgrade their education systems. But, although we achieved success on a limited budget, the challenge that fiscal constraints can pose should not be underestimated \u2013 especially for the low- and middle-income countries, often in Africa, that face the biggest educational challenges today.\n\nAs a member of the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity, I have seen firsthand how often governments\u2019 desire to move education up their list of priorities is thwarted by fear of budgetary shortfalls and domestic pressure. As a result, promises to achieve universal primary education are consistently deferred.\n\nWhen a government commits to improving education, it is betting that equipping its citizens for an unknowable future will yield broad-based, society-wide progress. This is good not only for the country itself but also for its neighbors, for which a more stable and prosperous neighborhood can only be beneficial. In fact, given the interconnectedness of today\u2019s global economy, better education in one country can bring benefits far beyond regional borders.\n\nClearly, the international community has an interest in supporting any government that makes the ostensibly obvious, yet practically difficult, decision to place education at the forefront of its agenda. And thanks to the visionary leadership of Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, this imperative is receiving the attention it deserves. Indeed, it will be a central theme at this week\u2019s financing commission summit in Oslo.\n\nTanzania\u2019s experience proves that transforming a country\u2019s education system is possible, even if that country faces severe fiscal constraints. It is not quick or easy, and it often requires difficult trade-offs. But with a strong and sustained commitment to fulfill the promise of universal primary and secondary education \u2013 and a little international support \u2013 governments can ensure happier, more prosperous lives for their countries\u2019 young people.

From 2000 to 2009, the number of students in elementary school in Tanzania more than doubled. It went from just over 4 million pupils to 8.5 million. Ninety-six percent of Tanzania's school-age children are now in school.\u00a0\n\nProgress can also be seen at the secondary, or high school, level. Over the same period, the number of secondary schools in Tanzania more than quadrupled, from 927 to 4,102. The number of students in school also increased dramatically. It went from just over 250,000 students to nearly 1.5 million.\n\nWhat changed? Tanzania\u2019s leaders, including me, recognized the value of a strong education system. So we committed ourselves to building one.\n\nPresident Makes A Decision\n\nFew would argue that education is not important. Often, governments work to provide for people's basic needs. These can include clean drinking water or roads to markets and hospitals. Education can fall by the wayside. But to let this happen is a mistake. Nothing can improve a country's future as well as education can.\n\nIt is this understanding that inspired me, as president of Tanzania, to make education my No. 1 concern. It was not an easy decision. I knew that some people would disagree with me. Many would have wanted Tanzania\u2019s limited public money to go to building wider highways or taller government buildings. Some wanted to spend more on the military.\n\nI knew that putting money into education meant believing in my country\u2019s future. I decided that we would pledge 20 percent of our country's money to education. This money was used for building more and better schools. We accomplished this through paying for teachers, books and technology. After all, simply having more kids go to school would mean little if they were not given all the tools they needed to succeed.\n\nTanzania can serve as a useful model for other countries seeking to upgrade their education systems. Although we have been successful, the challenges that limited money can pose should not be underestimated. This is especially true for poorer countries. These countries, often in Africa, face the biggest educational challenges today.\n\nBetter Education Helps Everyone\n\nI have seen how often governments\u2019 desire to fix their educational systems is overcome by their fear. They are afraid of worsening their money problems or angering their people. As a result, their promises to have all children go to elementary school are consistently put off.\n\nWhen a government commits to improving education, it is betting that its country and all of its citizens will be better off in the future for it. This is good for the country as well as its neighbors. A more stable and fortunate neighborhood can only be positive.\u00a0In today's world, we are all connected. Better education in one country can bring benefits far beyond that region's borders.\u00a0The global community has an interest in supporting any government that wants to improve education but has a difficult time putting their plans into action.\u00a0\n\nTanzania\u2019s experience proves that transforming a country\u2019s education system is possible, even with limited money.

But making sure all children can go to a good school can change a country for the better.\u00a0\n\nI was the president of a country called Tanzania. This change is what happened in my country. Over nine years, the number of students in school in grade school in Tanzania more than doubled. Tanzania now has almost 100 percent of its children in grade school. Many more students went to high school, too.\u00a0\n\nWhat changed? Tanzania\u2019s leaders saw the value of strong schools.Then we decided to build them.\n\nAlmost everyone agrees that school is important. Often, governments are too busy trying to provide for people's basic needs. For example, people need clean drinking water and roads to hospitals. Schools can be forgotten. This is a mistake. Nothing can make a country stronger the way good schools can.\n\nPaying For Good Teachers\n\nThis is what inspired me to make school the most important thing for my government. It was not easy. Many peopled wanted Tanzania\u2019s money to go to highways or buildings. Some wanted to spend more on the army.\n\nPutting money into schools meant believing in my country\u2019s future. I decided that we would use a large amount of our country's money for schools. We built more and better schools. We paid for good teachers, books and technology.\u00a0\n\nOther countries can look at Tanzania as an example. My country can show them how to make their schools better. But the problems caused by not having enough money should not be forgotten. This is very true for poor countries, often in Africa. These days, they face the biggest problems when it comes to schooling.\u00a0\n\nSome Leaders Are Afraid\n\nI know governments want to fix up their schools. They are often stopped by fear. They are afraid of not having enough money for other important things. People will get angry if their needs are not met. So governments put off paying for better schools.\n\nWhen a government commits to paying for better schools, that is good for the country. It is also good for the countries near them. We are all connected. \u00a0Better schools in one country can bring change around the world.\n\nTanzania proves that improving schools is possible. It can be done even with little money. It is not quick or easy, though. \u00a0It takes strong leaders who keep their promises.

Photo: AP/Matt Dunham\nNEW YORK, N.Y. \u2014 Climate change affects everyone on Earth. We are not acting fast enough to deal with it.\n\nClimate change is the heating up of the Earth. It is caused by burning fossil fuels, which are natural fuels like oil, gas and wood. Burning them creates gases that spread throughout the atmosphere.\n\nMany People Just Don't Care\n\nMany people do not understand how dangerous climate change is. Sadly, many who do understand don't care enough to do anything about it. They ignore the benefits of living in a climate-friendly way and using clean energy, such as solar power.\n\nA recent Pew study found that 7 out of 10 Americans who are political independents did not really know how much climate change would hurt them. Political independents do not consider themselves to be Democrats or Republicans. Those are the two major political parties, or groups, in America. Pew is a research group.\n\nWorse still, Yale University researchers recently found that 4 out of 10 adults around the world have never even heard of climate change. In some poorer countries, like India, it is 7 out of 10.\n\nEducation Equals Understanding\n\nThese numbers can be improved. The Yale study found that the longer people stay in school, the more they know about climate change. We need to spend more money on education. This is the best way to help young people deal with this global problem. Education works in three ways. For starters, education gives information. It is important to the understanding of how climate change already affects our lives.\n\nThis is especially true in poor areas. They are greatly affected by floods and other disasters caused by climate change. These people must rebuild from scratch after each new disaster. They have a hard time getting ahead. If they understand that their world is changing, perhaps they can adapt better.\n\nSecond, many people don't care about climate change because they do not know much about it. Companies and people will be able to make more money if they know what it is. For example, in the African nation of Niger, education and better farming methods helped to double farm incomes for more than 1 million people. In 2014, more United States jobs depended on solar power than on coal mining. Coal is a fossil fuel.\n\nStill, many people say that dealing with climate change is too expensive. Almost 7 out of 10 people think their lives would change too much, the study found. This does not have to be the case. Education can change that kind of thinking.\u00a0\n\nThere is a third reason education is important. It is needed to invent new technology to fight climate change. These new technologies include clean and safe energy and climate-friendly agriculture. We cannot rely on tech companies or scientists to solve the climate problem. Solutions might come from them, but they will also come from villages and cities, and from farmers and manufacturers. They will come from people with very different ideas about the world around them.\n\nYoung People Are Paving The Way\n\nFortunately, younger people today are better educated. They also believe more strongly in climate-friendly technology. These young people are leading the way and forcing us all to think about what we are doing.\n\nThe government of Norway began the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity. I am a member of this group. We will meet this week in Oslo, Norway. I hope that we will deal with the big challenge of our time. Education is our best weapon.\n\nEducation is not only important for our life on Earth. It also will let us make changes that will help people in a more fair and climate-friendly way. We need more education to get us there.\n\nFelipe Calder\u00f3n, former president of Mexico, chairs the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "1220L": "Opinion: Education can provide understanding of climate change\nBy Felipe Calder\u00f3n, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n07.13.16\n\nA climate activist demonstrates in Paris, France, Dec. 12, 2015, during the COP21, the United Nations Climate Change Conference. Photo: AP/Matt Dunham\nNEW YORK, N.Y. \u2014 Climate change affects us all, but we still are not acting as quickly as we should to address its causes, lessen the damage and adapt to its effects. Many people don\u2019t understand the risks climate change poses to the world. Sadly, many who do understand dismiss the far-reaching benefits that sustainability and clean energy would bring about.\n\nAccording to a recent Pew study, 7 out of 10 Americans who are political independents were not very concerned that climate change would hurt them. Worse still, Yale University researchers recently found that 40 percent of adults worldwide have never even heard of climate change. In some developing countries, such as India, that figure climbs to 65 percent.\n\nThree Ways Education And Climate Change Work Together\n\nThese figures are discouraging, but they can be improved. The Yale study concluded that \u201ceducational attainment tends to be the single strongest predictor of public awareness of climate change.\u201d By investing in quality education, we can set the next generation on the right path to dealing with this global problem. Education and climate action work together in three ways. For starters, education fills knowledge gaps, and\u00a0 understanding how climate change is already having an impact on one\u2019s life can be useful.\n\nThis is especially true for poor populations that are most vulnerable to crop failures and natural disasters caused by climate change. These groups must rebuild from scratch after each new catastrophe, such as landslides and floods, and find it hard to begin again. By understanding that their world is changing \u2013 and that the likelihood of future disasters is increasing \u2013 these populations can become more resilient and learn to adapt to the stresses of a changing climate.\n\nSecond, education challenges apathy. Knowing how to address climate change can open up vast opportunities for economic growth. Global investors should be made to understand that sustainable solutions can increase well-being and create additional economic opportunities. To take one example, in Niger, education and better farming techniques helped to double farm incomes for more than 1 million people, while restoring huge tracts of land. In the United States, more jobs depended on solar energy in 2014 than on coal mining.\n\nStill, many people insist that what it takes to reduce the effects of climate change is too costly to our current way of life. According to the Pew study, almost 7 out of 10 people believe that they would have to make major lifestyle changes. This does not have to be the case, and education can challenge the kind of skepticism that shuts off opportunities for climate-smart living.\n\nFinally, education gives the technical knowledge needed to build a better future. Innovations include clean and safe energy, sustainable agriculture, and smarter cities. Giving more people access to education would lead to more homegrown innovation \u2013 entrepreneurs discovering ways to address local problems. Globally, we cannot rely on knowledge centers such as Silicon Valley or Oxford in England to develop a silver bullet to the climate problem. Solutions may come from tech hubs, but they will also come from villages and developing cities, and from farmers and manufacturers with vastly different perspectives on the world around them. This will create a positive cycle. It is easier for educated people to move and integrate into new places and share the knowledge they have brought with them.\n\nYounger Generations Provide Hope For The Environment\n\nFortunately, younger generations today are better educated and more committed to environmentally sound technology than were previous generations. They are leading the way and forcing us all to think about our own actions. But we must broaden the availability of education worldwide to ensure that their efforts are not in vain.\n\nIn recognition of education\u2019s importance, the government of Norway has established the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity, of which I am a member. We will meet this week in Oslo. It is my hope that we will confront the challenges of our time and act on the knowledge that education is our most important asset.\n\nAddressing the dangers of climate change is not only important for our continued life on Earth; it is also an opportunity to move toward a cleaner, more productive and fairer path of development. Only an educated global society can take the decisive action needed to get us there.\n\nFelipe Calder\u00f3n, former president of Mexico, chairs the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: Why climate change is an education issue\nBy Felipe Calder\u00f3n, Project Syndicate\n07.13.16\n\nA climate activist demonstrates in Paris, France, Dec. 12, 2015, during the COP21, the United Nations Climate Change Conference.

Knowing the measures available to address climate change can open up vast opportunities for economic growth. Global investors should be made to understand that sustainable solutions can increase well-being and create additional economic opportunities. To take one example, in Niger, education and improved farming techniques helped double real farm incomes for more than 1 million people, while restoring huge tracts of severely degraded land. In the U.S., as of 2014, there were more jobs that depended on solar energy than on coal mining.\n\nStill, many people insist that implementing measures to mitigate the effects of climate change is too costly to our current way of life.

According to the Pew study, almost 7 out of 10 people believe that they would have to make major lifestyle changes. This does not have to be the case, and education can challenge that kind of thinking.\n\nNew Ideas Should Come From Everywhere\n\nFinally, education is needed to create new technology to fight climate change. These new technologies include clean and safe energy, climate-friendly agriculture, and smarter cities. More education will lead to more local solutions. Globally, we cannot rely on tech companies or scientists to solve the climate problem. Solutions might come from these places, but they will also come from villages and cities, and from farmers and manufacturers. It will come from people with vastly different views on the world around them. This will create a positive cycle of change.\n\nFortunately, younger generations today are better educated and more committed to environmentally friendly technology than were previous generations. They are leading the way and forcing us all to think about our own actions. But we must make education available to more people worldwide for this to really have an effect.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nThe government of Norway recognized how important it is and began the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity. I am a member of this group. We will meet this week in Oslo. It is my hope that we will face the challenges of our time and act on the knowledge that education is our most important asset.\n\nDealing with the dangers of climate change is not only important for our continued life on Earth; it is also an opportunity to move toward a cleaner, more productive and fairer path of development. Only an educated global society can take the necessary steps to get us there.\n\nFelipe Calder\u00f3n, former president of Mexico, chairs the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "540L": "Opinion: More people need to learn about climate change\nBy Felipe Calder\u00f3n, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n07.13.16\n\nA climate activist demonstrates in Paris, France, Dec. 12, 2015, during the COP21, the United Nations Climate Change Conference. Photo: AP/Matt Dunham\nNEW YORK, N.Y. \u2014 The Earth is heating up. This is called global warming. Scientists say people burn too many fossil fuels. These fossil fuels come from nature. They include fuel from wood, oil and coal.\n\nWhy Climate Change Is Bad\n\nEveryone is affected by climate change. It causes more floods and storms. Many farmers cannot grow as much food. We need to deal with climate change, and we need to act fast.\n\nClimate change is very dangerous. Many people do not understand how dangerous it is. Other people do not care enough. They do not live in a climate-friendly way. They do not bother to do things that will stop climate change.\n\nYale University is in Connecticut. Yale scientists found that almost half of adults do not know anything about climate change. In poorer countries, most adults have never heard of it.\n\nThe study found something else important. The longer people go to school, the more they know about climate change. This means we need to spend more money to help people go to school.\n\nHow Education Can Help\n\nEducation works in three ways. First, education gives information. People need to learn about how climate change affects them.\n\nSecond, many people do not care about climate change. They do not know much about it. Also, many people do not want to do anything differently. They think it will cost too much money, but this is not really true. People might be able to make more money.\n\nNiger is a country in Africa. In Niger, farmers learned about climate change. They changed their way of farming. Now, more than 1 million farmers make twice as much money.\n\nNew Ideas Come From Different Places\n\nThere is a third reason why education is important. We need new technology to fight climate change. We need new ways of farming. We also need climate-friendly ways of getting power. We cannot rely on tech companies or scientists to fix the problem for us. Good ideas will come from villages and cities. They will come from farmers and companies. Ideas will come from people with different ways of looking at the world.\n\nYoung people are going to school longer. They are using more climate-friendly technology. The young people of the world are leading the way.\n\nThe government of Norway started a new group. It is called the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity. It will help people go to school. I am a member of this group.\n\nEducation is our best weapon.

It was taken on Sept. 13, 2012, in Lagos, Nigeria. Photo: Associated Press\nWhat value does the digital economy provide Africa? The largest technology companies all have strategies for getting their products into African markets, but few have plans to provide what Africans truly need: jobs in the economy of the future.\n\nAfrica\u2019s population is projected to soar from 1.2 billion today to 2.4 billion by 2050. Over the same period, the tech titans of Silicon Valley and other hubs will be using their stockpiles of cash to transform the global economy, through innovations such as self-driving vehicles, genetic modification and even the colonization of space.\n\nAnd yet the prospects are bleak for Africans interested in playing any sort of role in shaping how these technologies influence their lives. Everywhere one looks, the technology picture is the same. Free digital products have been useful. In some cases \u2013 such as email, mapping and social media \u2013 they have been transformative. But it hardly ever translates into local ownership. Even as tech revenues soar on the continent, almost no tech jobs are being created for Africans. Indeed, Silicon Valley could soon face a backlash similar to the reaction to Hollywood\u2019s failure to promote black talent.\n\nTech companies recognize the importance of Africa, which will soon account for a quarter of the world\u2019s young people. Asian companies like Samsung and Huawei are active on the continent and likely to outpace their flashier American competitors in the contest to introduce the much-vaunted Internet of Things. Microsoft and IBM have programs that target Africa, and General Electric has declared that it is seeking to turn itself into a \u201cdigital industrial giant\u201d on the continent. Twitter, Facebook and Google have gained the lion\u2019s share of digital traffic in Africa at almost no cost.\n\nApple, however, is nearly irrelevant, with a market share of less than 3 percent on the continent (where its iPhone is being outsold by the hapless Blackberry). The company has shown no sign that it intends to design any product that would be affordable in Africa.\n\nWhen it comes to jobs, every tech company looks as disconnected as Apple. The African-American employees of Twitter, Facebook and Google could fit on a single Airbus A380. African-born executives at these and other tech companies are even rarer \u2013 and those who have found jobs often are disillusioned. \u201cIt is soul-sucking to be a high-talent African at a Silicon Valley company,\u201d one African tech leader said in an interview with one of us. \u201cYou leave because you get tired of fighting for attention and authority, and being reminded how lucky you are to work for them.\u201d\n\nIn Africa, the employment opportunities are pitiful. Twitter has no operations in Africa. Google employs only about 100 people on the continent. And Facebook\u2019s lone African office is staffed with fewer than 50 people \u2013 hardly enough to run an average supermarket.\n\nEven if one disregards parochial employment practices, the space between the availability of technology products and the availability of tech jobs in Africa looms large. Targeted projects \u2013 such as Facebook\u2019s Internet.org \u2013 are designed to employ only experienced talent (almost always expatriates).\n\nTech companies fall over themselves to boast that they are creating jobs in Africa, touting training programs and start-up competitions. Google promises to train one million Africans in digital skills. But what\u2019s the value of tech training if there are no tech jobs?\n\nYoung African graduates in science, math and engineering are told they can get ahead by becoming entrepreneurs. But the continent lacks the capital, customer base and talent that give entrepreneurs in developed economies at least a remote chance of tech start-up success. Without good entry-level job opportunities to develop skills and pursue careers, African graduates are falling further behind.\n\nOffering real jobs to build an indigenous workforce is good business. It is the only path to a sustainable place in the African market \u2013 and it will also be the best source of Africa\u2019s future entrepreneurs.\n\nBruce Krogh is Director of Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Africa campus in Rwanda.

Everywhere they look, the picture is the same. Free digital products have been very useful, and in some cases \u2013 such as with email, mapping and social media \u2013 they have changed daily life.

Soon, a quarter of the world\u2019s young people will live there. Asian companies like Samsung and Huawei are active in Africa. They are likely to pull ahead of American companies in the contest to introduce the much-talked-about Internet of Things \u2013 that is, the idea of connecting objects, from factory machinery to washing machines, to the Internet and to each other, allowing them to communicate. Microsoft and IBM have programs that target Africa, and General Electric has declared that it is seeking to turn itself into a \u201cdigital industrial giant\u201d there.

The company has shown no sign that it intends to make any product that would be cheap enough for Africans to afford.\n\nIn Reality, Tech Companies Hire Very Few Africans\n\nWhen it comes to jobs, every tech company looks like Apple.

Photo: AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos\nThe absence of color angered me. On the plastic desk, my book selfishly claimed all the space, stretching out to lop off the edge and hang in the 2-foot space above my lap. The white page showed a fruit bowl created from gray and black ink on paper.\n\nNext to me, Sam\u2019s book covered only half the desk. His pencils, an eraser and a juice box \u2014 Welch\u2019s grape, never fruit punch \u2014 stood in a neat lineup. His fruit bowl burst with the bright colors found in nature. The apple was so red that it looked like you could pluck it from the page and eat it.\n\nMy enlarged books, without color and nearly double the size of standard textbooks, were what I received because I was a legally blind child who attended a public school in Waltham, Massachusetts. The books were hefty, and I hated them. Although larger text helped me to read and keep up with the subject matter, I saw only the difference between myself and my classmates. Face an inch away from the page, I wanted to read just like everyone else, to learn as they did, to see as they did.\n\nLegally Blind But Others Had Challenges, Too\n\nAs a legally blind third-grader, I was fortunate to learn in a standard classroom. Although I was a child with a disability, I learned alongside students who did not have disabilities. My teachers adjusted some of their lesson plans and practices. For example, when they wrote a \u201cb\u201d on the chalkboard, they described it at the same time: \u201cstraight line down, pencil halfway back up, and loop to the right.\u201d As for my classmates, they were eager to help me. They held my hand and traced along the paper. They read me problems off the board. They told me when to kick the ball at recess. After all, we all faced challenges. Some students had parents who fought a lot at home. Some kids arrived at school early for reduced-fee breakfast. Others had trouble with math or reading. We all ate and played together; we learned about and accepted our differences.\n\nThe adjustments made for me also benefited those around me. Children who preferred verbal stimulation heard how to draw the letter \"b\" while they saw it being written. The girl playing goalkeeper and not paying attention appreciated a heads-up that the soccer ball was headed her way as much as I did. For me, having a disability and learning in a classroom like everyone else was important. It allowed me to make friends and resolve arguments. It prepared me to go to the University of California (UC) at Berkeley, where I graduated with honors, and then on to law school at UC Irvine this fall.\n\nStudents With Disabilities Lucky In U.S.\n\nI was lucky to grow up in the United States. I attended schools with teachers, staff and parents who believed in me. Regretfully, this is not the case for many of the estimated 93 million children with disabilities around the world. The real figure is most likely higher. As the Human Rights Watch group has documented, students with disabilities often attend segregated schools, isolated from their peers and the community. Many students with disabilities do not attend school at all.\n\nIn South Africa, this number reaches nearly half a million as children with disabilities face discriminatory physical barriers and attitudes. These often begin early in their lives when government officials separate them based of their disabilities.\n\nStudents with disabilities often attend different schools than children who do not have disabilities and many students with disabilities do not attend school at all. For example, some school officials in Russia think children with disabilities are unable to learn, and are unsafe or disruptive. It is difficult for people with disabilities to enroll in universities or learn professional skills to get jobs.\n\nNations Agree To Educate All Children\n\nInternational treaties, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, require all children to receive an education. More than 150 nations ratified these treaties, which means they agreed to follow them.\n\nEvery child, regardless of disability, has the right to attend school with others. Until that right is realized, we continue to fail inside and outside the classroom. The opportunity to learn in my neighborhood school, to be exposed to viewpoints, situations and abilities that differed from my own, made me a more tolerant and compassionate person. It challenged me to stretch my notion of what I could achieve, and it provided me the support system and confidence to make those ambitions come true.\n\nYes, I hated those enlarged books. But, the important fact was that I read them next to Sam, in front of Mark and behind Joanne. For me, that made all the difference as I sipped from my juice box and went outside to play another round of soccer.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "550L": "Opinion: Schools work better when all kids can learn together\nBy Paras Shah, Human Rights Watch, adapted by Newsela staff\n06.20.16\n\nMembers of the White Hands Choir practice at a music school in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, March 10, 2011.

Many students with disabilities do not go to school at all.\n\nFor example, some schools in Russia think children with disabilities cannot learn.

On the plastic desk, my book selfishly claimed all the space, stretching out with graceless inefficiency to lop off the edge and hang in the 2-foot abyss above my lap. The immense white page depicted a fruit bowl of muted grays and indistinguishable blacks, an artificial creation of ink upon paper.\n\nNext to me, Sam\u2019s book covered only half the desk. His pencils, an eraser, and a juice box \u2014 Welch\u2019s grape, never fruit punch \u2014 stood in neat array. His fruit bowl burst with the vibrancy nature intended. The apple was so red you could pluck it from the page and feel juice dribble down your chin, the sweetness lingering.\n\nMy enlarged books, devoid of color, and nearly double the size of a standard textbook, were among the accommodations I received as a legally blind child in a public school in Waltham, Mass. The books were cumbersome and I hated them. Although larger text helped me to read and keep up with the subject matter, I saw only the difference between myself and my classmates. Face an inch away from the page, I wanted to read just like everyone else. To learn as they did, to see as they did.\n\nYet as a legally blind third-grader, I was fortunate to learn in a standard classroom, although my teachers had to adjust some of their lesson plans and practices. Drawing a \u201cb\u201d on the chalkboard came with oral instructions: \u201cstraight line down, pencil halfway back up, and loop to the right.\u201d My classmates held my hand and traced along the paper, eager to help. They read problems off the board and told me when to kick the ball at recess. We all faced challenges: some dealt with fighting parents or arrived early for reduced-fee breakfast, others had trouble with math or reading. Yet we bonded, as kids do, over the school year. We ate and played together. We celebrated triumphs and commiserated over setbacks. We learned about and appreciated our differences.\n\nFor me, having a disability and learning in an integrated classroom among my peers was essential. It allowed me to make friends and resolve arguments. I felt liberated and empowered \u2014 sentiments that continued to develop and carried me to a double major with honors from University of California (UC) Berkeley, and on to law school at UC Irvine this fall. The adjustments made for me also benefited those around me. Children who preferred verbal stimulation heard how to draw the letter \"b\" while they simultaneously saw it written. The girl playing goalkeeper and not paying attention appreciated a heads-up that the soccer ball was headed her way as much as I did.\n\nI was lucky to grow up in the United States and attend schools with teachers, administrators and parents who believed in me. Regretfully, this is not the case for many of the estimated 93 million children with disabilities around the world. The real figure is most likely higher.\n\nAs Human Rights Watch has documented, students with disabilities often attend segregated schools, isolated from their peers and the community. Many students with disabilities do not attend school at all. In South Africa, this number reaches nearly half a million as children with disabilities face discriminatory physical barriers and attitudes, often beginning early in their lives when government officials classify them on the basis of their disabilities.\n\nIn Russia, Human Rights Watch research has found that some school administrators refuse to admit children with disabilities because they believe these children are unable to learn, are unsafe around other children, or engage in disruptive behavior. Upon reaching adulthood, people with disabilities frequently struggle to enroll in universities or gain the meaningful professional skills necessary to secure employment.\n\nInternational treaties such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, both ratified by more than 150 nations, require all children to receive an education.\n\nEvery child, regardless of disability, has the right to attend a quality, inclusive school on an equal basis with others. Until that right is realized, we continue to fail inside and outside the classroom. The opportunity to learn in my neighborhood school, to be exposed to viewpoints, and circumstances, and abilities that differed from my own made me a more tolerant and compassionate person. It challenged me to stretch my notion of what I could achieve, and it provided me the support system and confidence to make those ambitions reality.\n\nYes, I hated those enlarged books.

Photo: AP Photo/Felipe Dana\nWhen Rio de Janeiro was picked as the city that would host the 2016 Olympic Games, the Zika virus had yet to reach Brazil. Billions of dollars have been invested in preparing for the Games since then.\u00a0\n\nNow, Brazil is the epicenter of the Zika outbreak and Rio de Janeiro state has the second highest number of suspected infections.\u00a0Should the 2016 Summer Olympic Games be postponed or moved elsewhere?\n\nThis is a difficult decision, and the facts are still not clear enough. That is why, last month, I joined 223 scientists and public health experts in signing an open letter to Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO). We are asking her to put together an independent group to advise both the WHO and the International Olympic Committee. Such a group would be best positioned to provide the unbiased evidence needed to balance public health against disruption to a great international sporting event.\n\nCurrent Strain Of Zika More Dangerous Than Any Other\n\nThe Zika virus is not new, but the strain that entered Brazil in 2013 is more dangerous than any known variant. A study published last month has confirmed that when the virus infects a pregnant woman, it can prevent normal brain development in her unborn child. The result is a rare condition known as microcephaly, characterized by a smaller than average head. In severe cases, microcephaly makes it impossible for a child to ever live an independent life.\n\nThe Brazilian outbreak of Zika virus has been linked with a particularly devastating form of microcephaly known as fetal brain disruption sequence. Until Zika spread to Brazil, only a handful of fetuses with that condition had been recorded. Recently, a study of 35 fetuses with microcephaly in Brazil found that 11 of them had fetal brain disruption sequence.\n\nThe latest research confirming the link between Zika and microcephaly builds on a recent study of pregnant women in Rio de Janeiro with symptoms suggestive of Zika infection. Of those in which the infection was confirmed, 29 percent were carrying a fetus with a serious abnormality. None of the women in whom the infection was not confirmed had an abnormal fetus.\n\nIn adults, Zika brings a high fever and a rash. More worryingly, it apparently can also lead to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a devastating and sometimes life-threatening disorder that can cause paralysis for several months or even years. The risk of developing Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome for an adult infected with Zika remains unknown.\n\nPregnant Women Should Not Travel To Brazil\n\nThe WHO has declared Zika a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern,\u201d and has advised pregnant women not to travel to Brazil. However, how does staying at home help a pregnant woman if others bring the virus back from Rio? With 500,000 people expected to attend the Olympics, that is likely to happen in several countries in which Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that can transmit the virus, is present.\n\nTwo arguments will be made against this reason for postponing or moving the Games. First, the risk of infection in winter is low, as there are fewer mosquitoes, and Brazil is using the military to spray areas where mosquitoes breed. However, some scientists point to a worrying fact: While the transmission of dengue fever, a virus that is related to Zika and transmitted by the same species of mosquito, declines during the the Rio winter, it does not cease altogether. The same is likely to be true of the Zika virus.\n\nAs for the spraying, it may not be all that effective, given that Rio has seen a sharp, unexplained increase in dengue this year. The neighborhood of Olympic Park, where events will take place, has had more cases of dengue in the first quarter of 2016 than in all of 2015.\n\nPerhaps Spread Of Zika Is Inevitable\n\nThe second response is to say that millions of tourists visit Rio anyway, so the spread of Zika to other countries is bound to happen one way or another. According to this line of thinking, it makes little difference whether visitors who bring it back to their home countries went to the Olympics.\u00a0\n\nHowever, as a result of the Brazilian outbreak, research into Zika has accelerated. It is now reasonable to hope that a vaccine, anti-viral drug or other means of combating the infection or its spread will be found.\n\nSo when the infection spreads is critical. If the Olympics go ahead as scheduled, visitors will come to Brazil from many more countries than would otherwise be the case. If they bring Zika back to regions with inadequate health-care systems \u2014 West Africa or South Asia, for example \u2014 millions of infections could occur before effective means of prevention or cure are developed.\n\nWHO Not In Favor Of Canceling Olympics\n\nThe WHO has said that canceling the Olympic Games would \u201ccompromise the huge investment that athletes and others have made in preparing for what should be a fantastic occasion.\u201d No doubt it would, but that needs to be balanced against the risks of spreading a dangerous virus. The Olympic Charter asserts that social responsibility and respect for fundamental moral principles are at the core of the Olympic movement.\n\nIt is neither socially responsible nor moral to ignore the risks that the Zika virus poses to adults and to children yet to be born. Perhaps the risks are low enough to justify going ahead with the Rio Olympics, but perhaps they are not.

Photo: AP Photo/Felipe Dana\nThe Olympic Games are the world's biggest sporting event. Athletes from around the world gather together every four years in a different city. The winners of each event are declared the very best at their sport.\u00a0\n\nIn 2009 the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro was picked to hold the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. Since then, billions of dollars have been spent preparing for the Games. Brazilians are proud and excited.\n\nNow, they and many people around the world are also very worried. In 2013, a terrible sickness suddenly appeared in Brazil. The sickness is caused by the Zika virus, and is spread by mosquitoes. The area in and around Rio de Janeiro now has the second highest number of cases in the country.\n\nZika Is Very Dangerous For Pregnant Women\n\nThe Zika virus is not new. However, the kind that entered Brazil in 2013 is more dangerous than any other known type. If it enters the bloodstream of a pregnant woman, it can damage the brain of her unborn child. The baby's brain does not develop properly and the head ends up being unusually small.\u00a0\n\nThe name for this condition is microcephaly. People with bad cases of microcephaly cannot live regular lives and need someone to take care of them.\n\nMany people are worried that the kind of Zika virus in Brazil will spread to other countries. In fact, it has already shown up in a few places.\n\nFor that reason, an important question has be asked. Should the 2016 Summer Olympic Games be moved elsewhere?\n\nOpinions Differ On Whether To Cancel The Games\n\nThis is a difficult decision, and the facts are still not clear enough. A group of experts should be put together right away to help the Olympic Committee make the right choice.\n\nThe World Health Organization has advised pregnant women not to travel to Brazil.\u00a0\n\nHowever, how does staying at home help a pregnant woman if others bring the virus back from Rio? Half a million people are expected to attend the Olympics. It seems very likely that some of them will bring the virus back to their home countries. The disease could then start spreading quickly in many new places.\n\nThree Reasons Why It's Safe\n\nStill, some people say it is safe to hold the 2016 Games in Rio. They give three main reasons for thinking this.\u00a0\n\nFirst, the Games will be held in August, during Brazil's winter, which runs from June to September. The danger of the disease spreading is lower in winter, as there are fewer mosquitoes around.\u00a0\n\nSecond, Brazil is spraying the areas where mosquitoes breed. The government says that should kill off most of the mosquitoes.\n\nMany scientists are not convinced, however. Some point to dengue fever, a virus related to Zika. While the spread of dengue fever goes down during the Rio winter, it does not stop altogether. The same is likely to be true of the Zika virus.\n\nAs for the spraying, it does not seem to work that well. Even with the spraying, cases of dengue fever are up sharply this year.\n\nThe third reason for keeping the Olympics in Rio is that millions of vacationers will visit Rio anyway. The spread of Zika to other countries is bound to happen sooner or later. Therefore, canceling the Olympics will not make any real difference, some say.\n\nDifficult Decisions\n\nAgain, many scientists do not agree with this. They believe a cure or a way to stop the spread of the virus may be found soon. For that reason, everything should be done to stop the disease from spreading now.\u00a0\n\nIf the Olympics go ahead, Brazil will have many more visitors than usual. They will come from many more countries than would otherwise be the case. The danger that the disease will begin spreading will be greater than usual.\n\nIt would not be responsible to ignore the risks. Perhaps it is safe to hold the Olympics in Rio, but perhaps it is not. We should not take the chance.\n\nPeter Singer is Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University and Laureate Professor at the University of Melbourne.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "550L": "Opinion: A virus might stop the Olympic Games\nBy Peter Singer, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n06.09.16\n\nThis April 11, 2016, photo shows Carioca Arena 1 behind palm trees inside Rio 2016 Olympic Park in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Photo: AP Photo/Felipe Dana\nThe Olympic Games are the world's biggest sporting event. Each country sends its very best players. The winners of the Games are the best in the world.\u00a0\n\nThe Summer Olympics happen every four years. Each time they take place in a different city. Many cities hope to get picked. It is a big honor to hold the Games.\n\nIn 2009 the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro was picked. The 2016 Games are supposed to happen there.\n\nNow, many people are very worried, though. In 2013, a terrible illness suddenly appeared in Brazil. The illness is caused by the Zika virus. It is spread by mosquitoes.\n\nZika Is Dangerous For Pregnant Women And Their Babies\n\nThe Zika virus is a big danger for pregnant women. It can hurt the unborn child inside them.\u00a0\n\nZika can stop a baby's head from growing the way it should. The head ends up much too small. The baby cannot think or move well.\u00a0\n\nSo far, the Zika virus is mostly in Brazil. Many people are worried it will spread to other countries.\n\nHalf a million people could come to Rio for the Olympics. Some of them might bring Zika home with them.\n\nFor that reason, perhaps the 2016 Olympics should not happen in Rio.\n\nSome People Think The Games Should Go On\n\nSome people say it is safe to hold the Games there. They give two main reasons.\u00a0\n\nFirst, the Games would happen during Brazil's coldest time of year. There will not be many mosquitoes around then. For that reason, Zika is much less likely to be spread, they say.\n\nMany scientists worry that is not true. They think Zika may continue to spread, even with the cold weather.\n\nThere is a second reason for keeping the Olympics in Rio. Many people will visit the city no matter what. Some of them will catch Zika.\u00a0\n\nHolding the Olympics in a different city is pointless, some people say. It will not make any difference. Zika will spread anyway.\n\nOther People Think The Games Should Be Stopped\n\nMany scientists think this is wrong. They believe they will find a way to stop Zika soon. It is important to keep it from spreading now.\u00a0\n\nThe Olympics would bring many more visitors than usual to Rio. They would come from many more countries than usual. The illness would be more likely to spread quickly.\n\nPerhaps it is safe to hold the Olympics in Rio. Perhaps it is not.

These mines are operated with simple machinery and are run informally, so they are not tracked by any government.\n\nThe OECD's Due Diligence\n\nThis week, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has a chance to do something about this. The OECD is an international organization based in Paris that studies and coordinates economic policies among its member states. In the case of minerals, it evaluates whether current sourcing meets its own 2011 Due Diligence Guidance. The Guidance sets out five steps that companies need to take to avoid serious human rights abuses, such as the worst forms of child labor. It applies not only to war-torn regions, but also to \u201chigh-risk\u201d areas with institutional weaknesses such as Ghana.\n\nSo far, the OECD has not done enough to tackle child labor in minerals supply chains. Its focus has been on the important issue of conflict minerals, where companies source raw materials from the conflict-torn Great Lakes region in Africa. The OECD had laid out the steps to source these minerals responsibly. However, the specific issue of child labor has been given far less attention. This lack of tangible action is as much a responsibility of the OECD as it is of the governments and companies involved.\n\nHuman Rights Watch Outlines Problems With Child Labor\n\nHuman Rights Watch has documented the risks children face when they work in local small-scale gold mining. Children have died when mining pits collapsed, suffered injury from accidents and risked mercury poisoning. Mercury, a liquid metal used to attract gold particles during the processing of gold ore, causes brain damage, heart and lung conditions and other permanent health problems. Work in mining also takes a toll on children\u2019s education: child miners often find it difficult to attend school regularly, and sometimes drop out altogether.\n\nHuman Rights Watch research in Ghana, Mali, the Philippines and Tanzania has found that governments and businesses are not doing enough to tackle child labor in mining. These countries have laws and government institutions to eliminate child labor, but the laws remain unenforced, and the institutions are weak. Businesses sometimes fail to do their due diligence to ensure that supply chains are free from child labor. Many local gold traders do not check the labor conditions at the mining sites they source from, and sometimes even buy gold from child laborers. It is easy then for tainted gold to enter the supply chains of global companies. Around 15 percent of the world\u2019s gold supply comes from small-scale gold mines.\n\nIn Ghana, we found that traders bought gold from unlicensed mines, where child labor was common. They then sold it to export companies which had insufficient safeguards in place to identify and filter out gold mined by children. Some of these companies exported gold to leading refineries in Dubai and Switzerland, such as Metalor, Emirates Gold and Kaloti. This way, gold processed by Joshua may end up in our watches, smartphones or other goods.\n\nProposed Safeguards\n\nThere are some hopeful signs at the OECD. At this week\u2019s OECD conference, participants will debate a potential toolkit that companies could use to detect child labor in their supply chains. The OECD is also increasingly integrating child labor issues into its work. These are good first steps that could convince mineral companies that safeguards against child labor are possible.\n\nWhat is needed is a concerted effort by the OECD, governments and companies. Companies at all points in the supply chain should conduct robust child labor due diligence. They need to have management systems in place to identify child labor risks in the supply chain, respond to the risks identified, carry out independent third-party monitoring and publicly report on their due diligence efforts. In addition, companies should work on a broader industry effort against child labor in mining, akin to similar industry-led efforts against child labor in cocoa and tobacco. The OECD should support such projects by providing guidance, a space for discussion and seeking expert input.\n\nFinally, the OECD and its member states need to sharpen their teeth. Voluntary codes of conduct and standards are not enough to achieve responsible sourcing by minerals companies. The OECD should create a mechanism to effectively monitor implementation of their Due Diligence Guidance, including reviewing it regularly and publicly. Member states should also make human rights due diligence a legal requirement for all business areas. This is already being considered by the French parliament.\n\nLater this month, states will vote on an international treaty for human rights and global supply chains at the International Labor Conference. Taking these steps would help make the future of children like Joshua look brighter.\n\nJuliane Kippenberg is associate director of the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "870L": "Opinion: Child labor still a problem in minerals industry\nBy Juliane Kippenberg, Human Rights Watch, adapted by Newsela staff\n06.07.16\n\nA child stands next to blackened zinc sheets, used in illegal gold mining, at the municipal-owned G Hostel on the outskirts of Welkom, South Africa, Oct. 10, 2007.

The OECD is formed by countries all over the world. It studies and coordinates economic laws within each of these countries.\n\nIn 2011, the OECD wrote the Due Diligence Guidance. This document gives five steps that companies need to take to respect human rights. It applies not only to war-torn regions, but also to \u201chigh-risk\u201d areas like Ghana.\n\nSo far, the OECD has not done enough about child labor in the mineral business. It has instead concentrated on the fact that companies buy raw materials from war-torn Central and East Africa. Child labor has received far less attention.\n\nRisks Of Child Labor\n\nThe Human Rights Watch is in charge of looking at human rights internationally. It has documented the risks children face in small-scale gold mines. Children have died or been injured when mining pits have collapsed.\u00a0\n\nThey have also risked mercury poisoning. Mercury is a chemical that causes brain damage, heart and lung conditions and other health problems. Work in mining can also get in the way of children's education. Child miners often find it difficult to attend school regularly. Sometimes, they drop out altogether.\n\nBusinesses sometimes do not make sure that their raw materials did not come from child labor. Many gold traders do not check the labor conditions at the mines they buy from. Sometimes, they even buy gold from child workers. This gold is then used by global companies.\n\nIn Ghana, we found that traders bought gold from unlicensed mines. Child labor was very common in these mines. Some of this gold was sold to big companies like Metalor, Emirates Gold and Kaloti. These companies sell their products across the world. This is how gold processed by Joshua may easily end up in our watches, smartphones or other goods.\n\nWhat Does The World Need To Do?\n\nThere are some hopeful signs at the OECD. At this week\u2019s OECD meeting, participants will discuss a suggested set of tools for companies. The tools could be used to see if child labor was used to get their raw material. The OECD is also talking about child labor more frequently. These are good first steps.\n\nWhat is needed is for the OECD, governments and companies to work together. Companies need to have systems in place to discover child labor risks. The systems should be monitored by someone or a group from outside the company. Finally, every company should report publicly about their efforts.\n\nCompanies should also cooperate with each other. This kind of effort has already been used against child labor in cocoa and tobacco fields. The OECD can provide a space for comparing ideas and bringing in thoughts from experts.\n\nFinally, the OECD and its member states need to sharpen their teeth. It is not enough to expect minerals companies to be responsible. The OECD should set up a system to effectively check the implementation of the Due Diligence Guidance. The system should include regular and public reviews. Member states should also make due diligence the law for all businesses.\n\nLater this month, countries from across the world will vote on a treaty for human rights in the global market.

Photo: REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\nPRO: Parents, local school boards can do a better job\nThe U.S. Department of Education opened its doors 36 years ago. Its supporters promised improved efficiency and higher student achievement. Instead, federal spending has soared, and student achievement has barely budged.\n\nClearly, politicians in Washington don't know best. It\u2019s time for federal authorities to butt out of America\u2019s schools and put parents and their locally elected boards back in charge.\n\nThe longest running national assessment of American student achievement is the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The results are known as the Nation\u2019s Report Card.\n\nStudents across the country are tested in both math and reading, and results are reported on a scale of zero to 500. Students who score 300 or above can solve moderately complex math problems and understand relatively complicated reading materials.\n\nMath Slightly up, Reading Levels Off\n\nAmong 17-year-olds, typically high school seniors, the long-term performance in NAEP math has increased only slightly over decades. In 1978, 52 percent of students scored 300 or above, but 60 percent scored 300 or above in 2012, the latest year for which results are available.\n\nThe reading performance of 17-year-olds has remained flat, with just 39 percent of students scoring 300 or above in both 1971 and 2012.\n\nOver the same period, federal spending for elementary and high school education increased more than 140 percent, from $33.2 billion in 1971 to $80 billion in 2012. Student enrollment, meanwhile, increased only 9 percent, from 45.6 million in 1971 to 49.8 million in 2012.\n\nThe idea of a national education department was first debated in Congress in 1866. That year, Representative Samuel J. Randall of Pennsylvania predicted it would amount to \u201ca bureau at an extravagant rate of pay, and an undue number of clerks collecting statistics \u2026 (that) does not propose to teach a single child \u2026 its A, B, C\u2019s.\u201d\n\nHistory proves Randall was right.\n\nSo Much For Promises\n\nWe were promised that illiteracy would be eliminated by 1984. We were promised that high school graduation rates would reach 90 percent by the year 2000 and that American students would be global leaders in math and science. We were promised that by 2014 all students would be proficient in reading and math. None of this has happened, however.\n\nRather than learning from these broken promises, Congress continues to tinker with federal education programs that don't work and cost too much.\n\nIt\u2019s time to end the Department of Education and put the real experts \u2014 parents \u2014 back in charge of their children\u2019s education.\n\nParents are choosing their children\u2019s schools in a significant and growing majority of states. More than 1.7 million students are now home-schooled, and that figure has increased 62 percent in the past decade.\n\nResearch shows that when parents have more choices in education, both students and schools benefit, They do so much more cheaply than expensive federal programs. The competition for students and funding puts powerful pressure on schools to improve.\n\nLet Parents Manage Funding\n\nLittle wonder that some 7 out of 10 likely voters believe that competition improves public schools. They also support greater parental choice, particularly education savings accounts (ESAs).\n\nFirst passed in Arizona in 2011, and four more states since then, these savings accounts put parents in charge of the money for their children's education. ESAs allow parents to send their children to the schools that are best for them.\n\nAny leftover funds remain in students\u2019 ESAs for future expenses, including college tuition.\n\nInstead of funneling money through the government, we should be paying to educate American students directly through ESAs.\n\nUntil we put the real experts \u2014 parents and their locally elected representatives \u2014 back in charge of education, we can expect more education that over-promises and under-delivers from the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Vicki Alger is a research fellow at the Independent Institute in Oakland, California, and is the author of the book \u201cFailure: The Federal Misedukation of America\u2019s Children.\u201d She has a doctorate in political philosophy from the University of Dallas in Texas.

Half of California\u2019s 6 million public school children are poor or living just barely above the poverty line.\n\nOver half a million of these children are homeless, and 81 percent come from families in which the parents are working but still can\u2019t make ends meet.\n\nNearly 1 in 4 of California\u2019s students was born in a different country, and English is not the first language. One in 10 has a learning disability. Many of them show up at school just to eat a hot meal.\n\nThese kids need a lot of support, and the state simply won\u2019t foot the whole bill. Per-pupil spending in California is among the lowest in the country. Last year, the federal government contributed $7 billion to education in California. While this is only a fraction of the state\u2019s education budget, it needs this money to keep the schools open.\n\nFinancial support is not all that federal authorities provide.\n\nEducational Equality\n\nThe federal government has established a common vision and common standards for our schools. If we want our students to excel in college and compete with an international workforce, we must have the same educational expectations for all students.\n\nThere is no reason for one local board to decide that its students won\u2019t be taught that global warming exists, while another teaches that it does. If we want to produce informed, productive citizens, we can\u2019t allow local boards to lower the national expectations for student learning.\n\nEven more important than a common vision is advancing justice. Through civil rights legislation and monitoring, federal authorities have consistently intervened to protect the rights of students with disabilities, young women, poor students and students of color.\n\nBut the battle is not over, and our schools today are almost as segregated as they were in the days before the civil rights movement. Almost every district in the country has a gap between the achievement of black students and white students.\n\nFederal Officials Protect Children's Rights\n\nIt is the federal authorities, and not local school boards, who make sure that children have equal access to education regardless of whether they live in Bakersfield, California, the Appalachia mountains of West Virginia or New York City. It is the federal authorities who are now protecting the rights of transgender students to use the restroom.\n\nSeparate is not equal and has never been, but today, separate is also weak.\n\nResearch shows that countries with greater equality in education have better schools. This was the idea behind President George W. Bush\u2019s 2001 No Child Left Behind Act, which forced schools to test students in reading and math.\n\nAnd his idea makes good sense: If we want to improve education, we should hold schools responsible for the success of each and every student. We need a central authority to help us maintain this focus.\n\nLocal Governments Also Must Provide Support\n\nThis is not to diminish the role of local government in public education. I am a lifelong educator and have taught in California schools for years. While federal involvement is crucial, local governments can lead the way with school improvement.\n\nI am hopeful that California Governor Jerry Brown\u2019s local control of funding formula will better serve our students. The state program gives more money to schools for low-income students and students who are learning English because they have more needs.\n\nHopefully we can work together at a national and local level to build excellent schools that provide equal opportunities for all our students.\n\nUltimately education is about our kids, and if the federal government butts out entirely, our kids are the ones who will suffer.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Elizabeth Guneratne is a lecturer at Santa Clara University\u2019s School of Education & Counseling and has a master\u2019s degree in education from the University of San Francisco.

Proponents of its creation promised improved efficiency and higher student achievement. Instead, federal spending has soared, and student achievement has barely budged.\n\nClearly, Washington doesn\u2019t know best, and it\u2019s time for federal authorities to butt out of America\u2019s schools and put parents and their locally elected boards back in charge.\n\nThe longest running nationally representative assessment of American student achievement is the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the results of which are known as the Nation\u2019s Report Card.\n\nLong-term trend results in both math and reading are reported on a scale of zero to 500. Students who score 300 or above can solve moderately complex math problems and understand relatively complicated reading materials.\n\nAmong 17-year-olds, typically high school seniors, the long-term performance in NAEP math has increased only slightly over decades, from 52 percent of students scoring 300 or above in 1978 to 60 percent faring as well in 2012, the latest year for which results are available.\n\nThe long-term reading performance of 17-year-olds has remained flat, with just 39 percent of students scoring 300 or above in both 1971 and 2012.\n\nOver the same period, federal appropriations for elementary and high school education increased more than 140 percent, from $33.2 billion in 1971 to $80 billion in 2012. Student enrollment, meanwhile, increased only 9 percent, from 45.6 million in 1971 to 49.8 million in 2012.\n\nIn 1866, when the idea of a national education department was first being debated in Congress, Rep. Samuel J. Randall, D-Pennyslvania, \u00a0predicted it would amount to \u201ca bureau at an extravagant rate of pay, and an undue number of clerks collecting statistics \u2026 (that) does not propose to teach a single child \u2026 its A, B, C\u2019s.\u201d\n\nHistory proves Randall was right.\n\nWe were promised that illiteracy would be eliminated by 1984. We were promised that high school graduation rates would reach 90 percent by the year 2000 and that American students would be global leaders in math and science. And we were promised that by 2014 all students would be proficient in reading and math. None of this has happened.\n\nRather than learning from these broken promises, Congress continues to tinker with ineffective and costly federal education programs.\n\nIt\u2019s time to end the U.S. Department of Education and put the real experts \u2014 parents \u2014 back in charge of their children\u2019s education.\n\nParents, regardless of their incomes or addresses, are choosing their children\u2019s public, charter, private and online schools in a significant and growing majority of states. More than 1.7 million students are now home-schooled, with that figure increasing 62 percent in the past decade.\n\nResearch shows that when parents have more choices in education, both students and schools benefit, and do so at a fraction of the cost of top-heavy federal programs. The resulting competition for students and their associated funding puts powerful pressure on schools to improve.\n\nLittle wonder that some 7 out of 10 likely voters believe competition improves public schools and support greater parental choice, particularly education savings accounts, or ESAs.\n\nFirst enacted in Arizona in 2011, and four more states since then, such savings accounts put parents in charge of their children\u2019s education funding, allowing them to customize the services that best meet their children\u2019s needs.\n\nAny leftover funds remain in students\u2019 ESAs for future expenses, including college tuition. Regular ESA expenditure audits by state education agencies provide unparalleled levels of public transparency and accountability.\n\nInstead of funneling money through the D.C. bureaucracy, we should be funding American students directly through ESAs.\n\nUntil we put the real experts \u2014 parents and their locally elected representatives \u2014 back in charge of education, we can expect more overpromising and under-delivering from the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Vicki Alger is a research fellow at the Independent Institute in Oakland, California, and is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cFailure: The Federal Misedukation of America\u2019s Children.\u201d She has a doctorate in political philosophy from the University of Dallas in Texas.

Its purpose was to make guidelines for education in the United States. It also collects information on schools and makes sure they treat all students equally. Its supporters promised the department would save the country money. They also said students would do much better in school. Instead, the government has spent much more money, and students are doing about the same.\n\nClearly, politicians do not know best. It is time for the government to stay out of America\u2019s schools. Parents and their local school boards should be back in charge.\n\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the oldest test given to all students in America. The results are known as the Nation\u2019s Report Card.\n\nResults in both math and reading are reported on a scale of zero to 500. Students who score 300 or above can solve somewhat difficult math problems and read somewhat difficult books.\n\nA Slight Improvement Only In Math\n\nMany 17-year-olds are in their last year of high school. They have gotten only slightly better in math.\u00a0 In 1978, about half of students scored 300 or above. In 2012, about 6 \u00a0out of 10 students scored 300 or above.\n\nReading scores remained the same. Just 4 out of 10 students scored 300 or above in both 1971 and 2012.\n\nOver the same period, the government spent more than twice as much on schools. It went from $33.2 billion in 1971 to $80 billion in 2012. In 1971, 45.6 million students were in school. In 2012, there were 49.8 million.\n\nLawmakers first began talking about creating an education department in 1866. Samuel J. Randall was a lawmaker from Pennsylvania. He said it would be expensive, and there would be too many people working in it. An education department \"does not propose to teach a single child \u2026 its A, B, C\u2019s,\u201d he said.\n\nRandall was right.\n\nWe were promised that everyone would be able to read by 1984. We were promised that 9 out of 10 students would graduate from high school by the year 2000. We were promised that American students would be leaders in math and science. None of this has happened.\n\nLow Grade For Department Of Education\n\nLawmakers have not learned from these broken promises. Instead, they give us programs that do not work and cost too much.\n\nIt is time to shut down the Department of Education and put parents and local officials back in charge. They are the real experts.\n\nIn most states, parents are choosing their children\u2019s schools.\n\nWhen parents have more choices, both students and schools do better. Students do better at a lower cost. Schools have to compete for students and money so they improve.\n\nWe need to put the real experts \u2014 parents and their local elected officials \u2014 back in charge of education. Until we do, we can expect education that promises too much and does too little.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Vicki Alger does research at the Independent Institute in Oakland, California, and wrote the book \u201cFailure: The Federal Misedukation of America\u2019s Children.\u201d She has a doctorate from the University of Dallas in Texas.\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers. Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of Tribune or Newsela.\nCON: National government is better in handling the many problems schools have\nThe government should be more involved in schools. It should not leave education only up to local school boards.\n\nAcross the country, schools are not equal. There are wealthy schools and poor schools, good schools and bad schools. In some schools, all students are not treated equally, and in others, they are not. Local school boards simply are not up to dealing with all these problems\n\nCalifornia, for example, is one of the richest states in our nation. You would never know it from its schools.\n\nHalf of California\u2019s 6 million public school children are poor. Many students come to school just for a hot meal.\n\nMany Students Need Help\n\nOver half a million of these children are homeless. A total of 8 out of 10 have parents that work but do not make enough to support their children.\n\nNearly 1 in 4 of California\u2019s students was born in a different country, and English is not the first language. One in 10 has a learning disability. They may have trouble learning how to read or do math.\n\nThese kids need a lot of help, and the state simply will not pay. Of all the states, California spends among the least on every student. Last year, the American government gave $7 billion to education in California. The state needed this money just to keep the schools open.\n\nNational Government Sets Standards\n\nYet, the government provides more than just money.\n\nThe government tells all schools they need to give children a good education. We want our students to do well in college, so we must have high goals for them.\n\nSchool boards all have different standards. They tell their schools they must teach different things. Global warming is when the earth heats up. One local board may decide that its students will not be taught about global warming. Meanwhile another teaches it.\n\nEven more important, the government makes sure that schools are fair. The government protects the rights of all students no matter where they live.\n\nToday, most black and white children go to different schools. They do not get an equal education. Many black students do not do as well their white peers.\n\nIn 2001, Congress passed a law called the No Child Left Behind Act. It says schools must test students in reading and math. It makes sure schools are doing a good job and teaching students what they need to learn.\n\nFair To All\n\nThe idea makes good sense. If we want to improve education, schools must make sure each and every student does well. We need a national department to help us keep on track.\n\nLocal governments are important, too. I have taught in California schools for years. Local governments can lead the way in making schools better.\n\nHopefully, we can work together to build excellent schools. All children should have an equal chance to succeed.\n\nEducation is about our kids.

American schools have many problems. School boards are not able to deal with them. The American government should be more involved.\n\nCalifornia is one of the richest states in our nation. You would never know it from its schools.\n\nCalifornia has 6 million school children. Half of them are poor. Many of them come to school to eat a hot meal.\n\nNearly 1 in 4 of California\u2019s students was born in a different country. They need help learning English. One in 10 has a problem learning.\n\nCalifornia Schools Need More Money\n\nThe state does not give schools enough money. Last year, the American government gave $7 billion for education in California. The state needs this money to keep the schools open.\n\nThe government provides more than just money.\n\nIt tells schools they must give children a good education. It sets goals for all schools.\n\nThe government also makes sure schools are fair. All students must be treated equally.\n\nOur schools today are almost as separate as they were 65 years ago. Most black children and white children go to different schools. These children do not get an equal education.\n\nThe government also tells schools to test students in reading and math.\n\nAmerican Government Watching Schools\n\nThe idea makes good sense. We must make sure that all schools are doing a good job. The American government helps keep schools on track.\n\nLocal governments are important, too. I have taught in California schools for years. Local governments can lead the way in making schools better.\n\nHopefully, we can work together to build excellent schools.

Photo: AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster\nTOKYO, Japan \u2014 Barack Obama will soon become the first U.S. president to visit Hiroshima. This is not only a demonstration of his own personal\u00a0dignity, but it shows a brighter side of\u00a0America: the country that has tried to keep the\u00a0peace since the atomic bombings at the end of the second world war.\n\nIn coming to Hiroshima, Obama will learn the pain of a nation that was once America\u2019s enemy, but which is now a devoted friend. He will examine the ruins of the nuclear bomb sites at Hiroshima and Nagasaki and recognize the Japanese people's sorrow. And in doing this, he will prove our countries' ties are unbreakable. Peace in Asia can only continue because of the alliance \u2013 that is, the political and military agreement \u2013 between the United States and Japan.\n\nA Strong Partnership, Despite A Painful Past\n\nObama\u2019s journey is also an important moment for Japan. In jointly recognizing the\u00a0pain caused by the atomic bomb strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, both countries will show the world how to maintain a bond of solidarity. Their 60-year-long partnership is one of many miracles of American politics.\n\nThe United States also deserves credit for promoting European unity. The help of the United States ensured lasting peace between France and Germany, nations that had recently been at war. The United States encouraged China to open up to the world, even as its leader Mao Zhedong tried to reassert himself in his nation's Communist government. And the United States brought a peaceful end to the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Generations of American leadership have paid off for\u00a0the world.\n\nUntil recently, America's relationship with Russia and China has been strained. Before 1991, Russia was part of the Soviet Union, a group of 15 countries that Russia largely controlled. Both it and China supported communism, a system where the government owns all property and people have few freedoms. They were opposed to the United States and its system that allowed for more business activity.\u00a0But America found leaders in even these countries who were willing to work together. These men were able to move beyond their own pasts and opinions to build a better and safer world. In Hiroshima, Obama will be standing alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the most powerful politician in the country. Their meeting will be a strong symbol of the Japan-US alliance and America's role in creating Asia\u2019s postwar order.\u00a0\n\nAfter all, Abe is the grandson of Nobusuke Kishi, former prime minister of Japan. He pushed a treaty with the United States through the\u00a0Japanese parliament, though it was very\u00a0controversial. He sacrificed his political career for the sake of Japan\u2019s future and peace in Asia.\u00a0Just 15 years before, Kishi had been an official in the Imperial Japanese government, which ruled Japan until the end of World War II. As such, he had seen the United States as his enemy. But he knew Asia would need a viable structure for maintaining peace after the war's end. And that structure had to be founded on a US-Japan alliance.\u00a0Kishi\u2019s actions, like those of many postwar European leaders, show why the present international order\u00a0has endured for so long. It is an order built by truly great politicians.\n\nLeaders With A Vision For The Future\n\nThese were leaders whose vision extended well beyond concern for their own careers. They had the wisdom and courage\u00a0to do what they felt was necessary for a peaceful future. They demonstrated a willingness to overlook their personal histories for the greater good of their people. Kishi and his peers in the United States and Europe refused to be bitter about the past. They chose not to poke at old wounds \u2013 even the radioactive wounds of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nBy visiting, Obama will draw attention to Hiroshima's scars and the\u00a0horror of the American nuclear attack. But his trip will also symbolize the need for peace in Asia, both now and in the future.\n\nThis is how memories of the past should be thought of. They are not a way to fuel citizens\u2019 anger against others and distract them from important problems at home, as some leaders do. Through our pain, we share a common bond as people. That bond must be stronger than differences in our cultures, beliefs and past actions. It is only by sharing our sorrows and our humanity that any of us can stand before the sacred dead of Hiroshima.\n\nYuriko Koike, Japan's former defense minister and national security adviser, was chairwoman of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party's General Council and currently is a member of the National Diet.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "680L": "Opinion: Obama makes historic visit to Japan\nBy Yuriko Koike, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n05.31.16\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama (right) delivers remarks along with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, Japan, May 27, 2016.

Photo: AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster\nTOKYO, Japan \u2014 Soon, Barack Obama will be the first U.S. president to visit Hiroshima. This proves he is a proud leader. But it will also remind the world of how the United States has worked toward world peace.\n\nAbout 70 years ago, the United States fought Japan in World War II. Near the end of the war, the United States dropped two powerful nuclear bombs on Japan. One of those bombs hit Hiroshima. Japan surrendered soon after.\n\nAmerica Pushed For Peace\n\nObama will get to see Hiroshima with his own eyes. He will learn about the suffering the bombings caused. In doing this, he will show that our countries' ties cannot be broken. The Japanese and American governments are very close.\u00a0Peace in Asia depends on their relationship. Their partnership\u00a0is one of America's contributions to the world. But the United States has tried to keep the peace elsewhere, too.\n\nMany European countries fought each other in World War II. When the war ended, the United States helped Europe come together.\u00a0After the war, China stopped communicating with the rest of the world.\u00a0The United States encouraged it to open up. For many years, Russia threatened nuclear war with the United States. But the United States ended their\u00a0standoff quietly. In this way, the world has benefited from the United States.\n\nJapanese Leaders Want The Best For Their Country\n\nIn Hiroshima, Obama will stand with Shinzo Abe. He is the leader of Japan's government.\u00a0Abe is the grandson of Nobusuke Kishi. Kishi used to have the job Abe does now. In 1960, he pushed a peace treaty with the United States through the\u00a0Japanese parliament. That is a part of the Japanese government similar to the United States Congress. The treaty meant the United States and Japan would work more closely together. Many Japanese thought what Kishi did was wrong. But Kishi made sure the treaty became law. He did it\u00a0for the sake of peace in Asia.\n\nKishi also worked for the Japanese government in World War II. Back then, the United States was his enemy. But he knew Asia would need a way of keeping peace after the war. He knew the United States and Japan would need to work together.\u00a0\n\nKishi and men like him were brave enough to look past their own experiences. They did what they felt was best for peace.\n\nThis is how history should be remembered.\u00a0We are all people.\u00a0We have all felt pain. That must be stronger than our differences. By sharing our heartbreak, we can respect those who died at Hiroshima.\n\nYuriko Koike is Japan's former defense minister and national security adviser.

Photo: AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster\nTOKYO \u2014 At a time when Donald Trump\u2019s indecency and vulgarity are distorting the world\u2019s view of America, Barack Obama\u2019s decision to become the first U.S. president to visit Hiroshima demonstrates anew his own great personal dignity. Moreover, it returns to the world\u2019s attention the outward, forward-looking America that has delivered stability and prosperity over the many decades since the atomic bomb was first used.\u00a0\n\nIn coming to Hiroshima, Obama will come to know intimately the deepest pain of a nation that was once America\u2019s enemy, but which is now a devoted friend. In examining the ruins of the nuclear abyss and recognizing our eternal sorrow, he will confirm our countries\u2019 now-unbreakable ties. And it is because of the alliance between the United States and Japan that peace in Asia and the Pacific will continue unbroken, whatever challenges may come.\u00a0\n\nObama\u2019s solemn trek is thus also a forward-looking moment for Japan. In the joint recognition by Japan and the United States of the horrors visited on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, both countries \u2013 the Pacific War\u2019s victor and the vanquished \u2013 will show the world how bonds of alliance and solidarity are forged and maintained.\u00a0\n\nThe emergence of a six-decade-old alliance from the ashes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is one of the many near-miraculous achievements of America\u2019s far-sighted post-1945 diplomacy. The United States also deserves credit for promoting European unity, which has ensured lasting peace between France and Germany (after three wars in a century); encouraging China\u2019s opening to the world, even as it was engulfed in the mayhem of the Cultural Revolution; and bringing the Cold War to a peaceful end.\u00a0\n\nSuccessive generations of American leadership and courageous statesmanship paid off for the world. And in all of these cases, America found leaders \u2013 even in the Soviet Union with Mikhail Gorbachev and China with Deng Xiaoping \u2013 who were able to transcend their own pasts and prejudices to build a better and safer world.\u00a0\n\nIn Hiroshima, Obama will be standing alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, creating a powerful symbolic link to the founding of the Japan-US alliance and that extraordinary period of diplomatic vision that created Asia\u2019s post-war order. Abe, after all, is the grandson of Nobusuke Kishi, the prime minister who pushed the treaty of alliance with the United States through a then-reluctant Japanese Diet, sacrificing his political career for the sake of Japan\u2019s future and peace in Asia.\u00a0\n\nJust 15 years before Kishi, then an official in the Imperial Japanese government, had been a sworn enemy of the United States in the Pacific War; but post-war stability in Asia, he understood, demanded a truly viable structure of peace. And that structure could only have as its foundation the United States and Japan united in solidarity.\u00a0\n\nKishi\u2019s actions, like those of Konrad Adenauer, Charles de Gaulle, Alcide De Gasperi and others in Europe at the dawn of European integration, demonstrate one of the reasons the post-war international system has endured for so long: It was built by statesmen in the truest sense of the word. These were leaders whose vision extended well beyond concern for their own political careers, and who had the wisdom and courage to act upon their understanding of what a future of peace and prosperity would require.\u00a0\n\nMuch of the courage they demonstrated consisted in their willingness to overcome their personal histories in quest of their peoples\u2019 greater good. Kishi and his counterparts in the United States and Europe saw that a different and better future was available only by refusing to rage against the past and poke at its wounds, even the radioactive wounds of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nThe eternal scars of Hiroshima will be acknowledged by Obama to remind us of the unfathomable horror inflicted by America\u2019s nuclear attack. But Obama\u2019s pilgrimage also symbolizes the shared recognition of the need \u2013 now and in the future \u2013 for peace in Asia and for unity between the peoples of Japan and the United States.\n\nThis is how historical memory should be used, not as a means to stoke citizens\u2019 anger against others, in order to deflect their attention from pressing domestic problems, as some leaders do, but to show that in our pain we share a common humanity that demands our allegiance. That allegiance must overcome our differences of interest, culture and, most of all, past actions. It is only in our ability to share our sorrows, and our humanity, that any of us can stand before the sacred dead of Hiroshima.\n\nYuriko Koike, Japan's former defense minister and national security adviser, was chairwoman of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party's General Council and currently is a member of the National Diet.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "890L": "Opinion: Obama will pay his respects to Japan during visit to Hiroshima\nBy Yuriko Koike, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n05.31.16\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama (right) delivers remarks along with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, Japan, May 27, 2016.

And in doing so, they will show the world how countries can remain friends. Their 60-year-long partnership is one of many great American contributions to the world.\n\nAfter World War II, the United States encouraged European countries to come together. Europe had been at war many times before. France and Germany had gone to war against each other several times.\u00a0The United States helped bring peace between\u00a0them.\u00a0When China became communist it\u00a0stopped trading and communicating with the outside world, but the United States encouraged it to open up. And when the Soviet Union (now Russia) threatened nuclear war, the United States ended the countries' standoff quietly. Years of American peacekeeping\u00a0have paid off for\u00a0the world.\n\nWorking Through Differences For The Greater Good\n\nNot long ago, America did not get along with the Soviet Union and China. Before 1991, Russia was part of the Soviet Union. It was a group of 15 countries that Russia largely controlled. Both the Soviet Union and China supported communism, a system where the government owns all property and people have few freedoms. They\u00a0were opposed to the United States and its system that allowed for businesses and people to buy and sell. But there were leaders in both countries who were willing to work with America.\u00a0These men were able to move past their own opinions to build a better and safer world.\u00a0In Hiroshima, Obama will be standing alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the country's leader. Their meeting will represent the strength of\u00a0the Japan-US relationship.\n\nAbe is the grandson of Nobusuke Kishi, another prime minister of Japan. He pushed a treaty with the United States through the\u00a0Japanese parliament, which is like the US Congress. Many Japanese people disagreed with his actions. But Abe made sure the treaty went into effect. He did it\u00a0for the sake of Japan\u2019s future and peace in Asia.\n\nJust 15 years before, Kishi had been a high-ranking member of the government that ruled Japan until the end of World War II. During those years, the United States was his enemy. But he knew Asia would need a plan to keep the peace after the war's end. He knew the United States and Japan would need to work together.\n\nHow To Be Good Leaders\n\nThese leaders were concerned about things more important than their own popularity. They did what they felt was necessary for a peaceful future.\u00a0Kishi and men like him, both in the United States and Europe,\u00a0were brave enough to look past their own experiences for the good of their people. They chose not to poke at old wounds, no matter how deep.\n\nThis is how events in history should be thought about. They are not a way to encourage citizens of one country to feel rage toward another. We have all felt pain, and we are all people. Our sameness must be stronger than our differences.

Yet it remains legal for kids as young as 12 to work on U.S. tobacco farms.\n\nIn recent years, the use of e-cigarettes by high schoolers has risen sharply. In 2005, only 1.5 percent of high school teens reported e-cigarette use, but by 2011, 16 percent of high school students used the products. In announcing the new regulations on e-cigarettes last week, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell said the move is \u201ccommon sense\u201d to protect children from tobacco.\n\nSuch \u201ccommon sense\u201d is still lacking in tobacco production. Working with tobacco leaves can cause acute nicotine poisoning, which can lead to symptoms like nausea, vomiting, headaches and dizziness. Some of the pesticides commonly used in tobacco farming are known neurotoxins, chemicals that can destroy nerve tissue. Yet 12-year-olds can work 50 or 60 hours a week on a U.S. tobacco farm \u2013 as long as it is not during school hours \u2013 and it is perfectly legal.\n\nPleas To The President\n\n\u201cSofia,\u201d a 17-year-old tobacco worker, can be seen in the photo at top in a tobacco field in North Carolina.

The New York Times and The Washington Post newspapers have also called on the administration for action. But so far, there have been no commitments to regulate child labor on tobacco farms.\n\nLet's Live By Our Words\n\nUnder the new regulations on e-cigarettes, manufacturers must meet standards set by the Food and Drug Administration. They also must place health warnings on packages and report any harm caused by the product. Most of these requirements will not go into effect for years, but the ban on sales to children younger than 18 will begin in 90 days. The devices vaporize a flavored nicotine solution that users then inhale and exhale, which means e-cigarettes are safer than cigarettes.\n\n\"We\u2019ve agreed for years that nicotine does not belong in the hands of children,\u201d Burwell said.\n\nIndeed. If the administration can implement a ban on e-cigarettes for children in 90 days, it can ban children from working with toxic tobacco plants.\n\nJo Becker is advocacy director of the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "830L": "Opinion: Kids need protection from tobacco farm health hazards\nBy Jo Becker, Human Rights Watch, adapted by Newsela staff\n05.27.16\n\n\u201cSofia,\u201d a 17-year-old tobacco worker, in a tobacco field in North Carolina.

Soon, no one younger than 18 will be allowed to buy e-cigs in the United States.\n\nE-cigarettes can cause health problems. The nicotine in them is not harmless. Nicotine comes from the tobacco plant. Tobacco farms have many kids working on them. Even though there will be new e-cig rules, younger kids will still be allowed to work on tobacco farms.\n\nMore high school students these days are using e-cigarettes. In 2005, about 1 out of 100 teens said they smoked. By 2011, about 1 out of 8 high schoolers said they used them.\n\nNicotine is heated inside the e-cig and turned into vapor. Then users breathe the vapor. It is safer than breathing burning tobacco, but not safe enough, experts say.\n\nTobacco Leaves Are Dangerous\n\nSylvia Burwell is the secretary of Health and Human Services in the United States. Last week, she announced the new rules for e-cigarettes. Stores will not be able to sell them to kids. She said the new rules make sense to protect children from tobacco.\n\nThere needs to be more concern about tobacco farming. Working with tobacco leaves might cause nicotine poisoning. People can throw up, get headaches and become dizzy. Pesticides commonly are used in tobacco farming to kill bugs. Some of them can harm the brain. Yet 12-year-olds can work 50 or 60 hours a week on an American tobacco farm. They are not allowed to work during school. Otherwise, it is perfectly legal.\n\nSofia is a 17-year-old tobacco worker.

I live with a teenager myself, so I have heard your reasons. And I respect them, truly I do.\n\nFirst of all, you are tired. I mean, really, really tired. Too tired to eat, in fact. You are growing like a weed, your homework and extracurricular activities are endless, and your sense of time is shifting - so you naturally stay up later. When you are so fatigued in the morning, the idea of eating breakfast is unappealing. You genuinely are not hungry, and some of you might actually feel nauseated.\n\nMany of you choose to model yourself after your parents, who chug coffee, and coffee alone, in the morning. It's not your fault; you thought they knew best.\n\nOthers think you can maintain or lose weight by skipping breakfast.\n\nI understand this reasoning: I was a teenager once. But could you please take a few minutes to hear me out? Because skipping breakfast potentially positions you to gain weight, lower your test scores, and develop heart disease. Yes, seriously.\n\nBreakfast = Brain Power\n\nTest scores of children who do not eat breakfast are generally lower than those who eat a well-balanced meal. Children who eat breakfast show improved academic performance, longer attention spans, greater attendance and decreased hyperactivity in school. So if you find yourself unable to focus in a class, think back to what you ate that morning.

Four out of five children do not get enough vitamins and minerals from lunch and dinner alone (especially iron, which is important for energy and blood health). They need a healthy breakfast to properly grow.\n\nKids, look at it this way: You get only one shot at this childhood growth thing, so don't mess it up.\n\n\"Hangry\" Much?\n\nSkipping breakfast can make you tired, grouchy and restless. The word \"hangry\" didn't secure a spot in the dictionary for no reason; it really happens.\n\nHealthy Wake-Up Call\n\nBreakfast is more important to your body than any other meal, because the time between dinner and breakfast tends to be the longest.

Stabilized blood sugar contributes to steady energy, fewer crashes and cravings, and a smaller chance of developing heart disease or diabetes and becoming overweight.\n\nEat Breakfast, Weigh Less\n\nBreakfast eaters tend to be more active throughout the day and less likely to be obese, so perhaps skipping breakfast isn't such a great tactic to lose weight.\n\nCoffee No \u2014 Try Breakfast To Go\n\nCoffee is not breakfast, no matter what your parents claim.

He is the solicitor general of India, which means he is the government's chief lawyer. He words shocked India and started an heated argument. People felt so strongly about it that the government now says it wants the diamond back.\n\nThe problem began with the All India Human Rights and Social Justice Front. The group asked a judge to force the government to ask for the diamond back. The Kohinoor is one of the world\u2019s oldest and most valuable diamonds. It is part of Britain\u2019s crown jewels.\n\nKumar told India's Supreme Court that an Indian kingdom offered the gem to the British in 1849. Also, Indian law does not let the government return antiques sent out of the country before India gained its independence. India used to be a British colony. It became an independent country in 1947. Kumar said the Indian government has no way to get the diamond back.\n\nPersians Take Gem From Temple\n\nPeople were very upset at Kumar. The government announced that it will ask for the diamond back. Unless it tells Kumar to go to the Indian Supreme Court, his words seem to have ended India\u2019s claim to the world\u2019s most famous diamond.\n\nHundreds of years ago, the Kohinoor was found by the Kakatiya rulers of India, who put it in a temple\n\nIn 1739, Persian king Nadir Shah took the diamond. It was Nadir Shah, or so legend has it, who called the diamond the Kohinoor. Its meaning is \u201cMountain of Light.\u201d A woman of his court said this about it: \u201cIf a strong man were to throw four stones \u2013 one north, one south, one east, one west \u2013 and a fifth stone up into the air, and if the space between them were to be filled with gold, it would not equal the value of the Kohinoor.\u201d\n\nIn 1809, the Kohinoor was given to the British by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, a king in India. His kingdom was defeated by the British in two wars. The last one was in 1849, when the Kohinoor was given to the British.\n\nA Gift? That's Nonsense\n\nThe British claim that the king offered the diamond to pay for the war. That argument is ridiculous. For starters, the last maharaja of the Sikh Empire, Duleep Singh, was only 10 years old. He most certainly was not given a choice. I have pointed out before that if you hold a gun to my head, I might give you my wallet, but that does not make it a gift. It also does not mean I should not get it back.\n\nSometimes, the losers of a war give money to the winners. The losers do not have a choice. Britain used to own many colonies around the world. Many of these former colonies rightly argue that Britain that owes them money. They say Britain stole their treasures and treated them badly. Returning priceless objects might be a good place to start.\n\nThe British have stolen many of the treasures of other countries and put them in their museums. It is a terrible problem. The British fear giving back even one item. They worry that if they do, every country will ask for their treasures back.\n\nKohinoor Adorns A Royal Crown\n\nIn 2010, British Prime Minister David Cameron visited India. The British leader declared that the Kohinoor would have to stay where it is. \u201cIf you say yes to one, you would suddenly find the British Museum would be empty,\u201d he said.\n\nKumar has taken Britain\u2019s side on the Kohinoor problem although for different reasons. Indian patriots like me are losing hope that we will get the diamond back. It is an important part of our history.\n\nBritain owes us. Instead of returning the diamond to the real owners, the British are showing it off on a royal crown.

The statement shocked India and unleashed passionate debate \u2013 so passionate, in fact, that the government scrambled to declare that it still wants the gem back. But the government\u2019s commitment to getting it remains unconvincing, at best.\n\n\n\nKumar made his statement before the Supreme Court in a response to a suit filed by the All India Human Rights and Social Justice Front. The group had demanded that the government seek the return of the famed diamond.\u00a0\n\nOne of the world\u2019s oldest and most valuable diamonds, the Kohinoor is part of Britain\u2019s crown jewels. Kumar claims that a former kingdom offered the gem to the British East India Company in 1849 as \u201cvoluntary compensation\u201d for the expenses of the Anglo-Sikh wars. In addition, the Indian Antiquities and Art Treasures Act does not permit the government to seek the return of antiquities exported before India gained its independence in 1947. According to Kumar, the Indian government has no way to secure the diamond\u2019s return.\n\nFrom India, \"A Mountain Of Light\"\n\nThe uproar that Kumar\u2019s statement triggered has forced government spokesmen to backpedal furiously, asserting that Kumar\u2019s was not the final official view. The Ministry of Culture announced that it will still file a claim for the diamond. But unless Kumar is instructed to file documents with the Indian Supreme Court, his statements appear to have ended India\u2019s claim to the world\u2019s most fabled diamond.\n\nHundreds of years ago, the Kohinoor was mined by the Kakatiya dynasty in what is now Andhra Pradesh. The Kakatiya kings installed it in a temple, which was raided by Sultan Alauddin Khilji, who took it back to his capital of Delhi.\n\nIn 1739, the Kohinoor fell into the hands of the Persian invader Nadir Shah, whose loot from his conquest of Delhi also included the priceless Peacock Throne. It was Nadir Shah, or so legend has it, who baptized the diamond the Kohinoor, or \u201cMountain of Light.\u201d One of his consorts memorably said this about it: \u201cIf a strong man were to throw four stones \u2013 one north, one south, one east, one west \u2013 and a fifth stone up into the air, and if the space between them were to be filled with gold, it would not equal the value of the Kohinoor.\u201d\n\nGift From A Child Ruler?\n\nUpon Nadir Shah\u2019s death in 1747, the diamond fell into the hands of one of his generals, Ahmad Shah Durrani, who became the Emir of Afghanistan. In 1809, one of Durrani\u2019s descendants was forced to give the Kohinoor to the powerful Sikh maharaja of Punjab, Ranjit Singh. The Sikhs were defeated by the British in two wars, and the British Empire took over the Sikh kingdom in 1849. That was when the Kohinoor was supposedly \u201cgifted\u201d to the British.\n\nThe British claim that the diamond was offered as \u201cvoluntary compensation\u201d for the money the British spent in the war. That argument is ridiculous. For starters, the formal handover was conducted by the last maharaja of the Sikh Empire, Duleep Singh, who was only 10 years old \u2013 and most certainly was not given a choice. As I have pointed out to other Indian politicians, if you hold a gun to my head, I might give you my wallet, but that doesn\u2019t make it a gift. It also doesn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t get it back.\n\nCompensation provided to the winners of a war by those they defeated is usually known as reparations. It is not entirely voluntary. In fact, many former colonies rightly argue that it is Britain that owes them reparations for centuries of oppression and looting. Returning priceless artifacts of cultural significance stolen at the height of imperial rule might be a good place to start.\n\nMany Claim To Own Priceless Gem\n\nTo be sure, the Kohinoor poses a particular challenge, owing to competing claims. The Iranians say that Nadir Shah stole it, while the Afghans assert that the Sikhs forced them to give it up. Now Pakistan has entered the ring, with the somewhat flimsy argument that the capital of the Sikh Empire was in Lahore. They tend to gloss over the fact that they drove the Sikhs out and hardly any Sikhs are left there. Given that the diamond spent most of its existence on or beneath Indian soil, Indians consider their claim self-evident.\n\nFor the British, however, the existence of contending claims is a major relief. It helps the country to fend off a blizzard of demands to undo the many injustices of two or more centuries of colonial exploitation of far-flung lands. The British theft of other peoples\u2019 heritage, from the Parthenon Marbles of Greece to the Kohinoor diamond, is a particular point of contention. The British fear that conceding any one item could open a Pandora\u2019s box of problems.\n\nIndeed, on a 2010 visit to India, Prime Minister David Cameron declared outright that the Kohinoor would have to stay put. \u201cIf you say yes to one, you would suddenly find the British Museum would be empty,\u201d he said. Kumar has essentially taken Britain\u2019s side on the Kohinoor issue, although for different reasons. And so Indian nationalists like me are losing hope that we will get that priceless element of our heritage back.\n\nBritain owes us. But instead of returning the evidence of their greed to the rightful owners, the British are flaunting the Kohinoor on the Queen Mother\u2019s crown in the Tower of London. It is a stark reminder of what colonialism truly was: shameless subjugation, coercion and misappropriation.

Photo: REUTERS/Siegfried Modola\nJOHANNESBURG \u2013 Kenya recently destroyed its entire stockpile of elephant ivory. More than 100 metric tons of \u201cwhite gold\u201d \u2013 both illegally harvested (confiscated from poachers or traders) and naturally accruing (from natural mortality) \u2013 went up in smoke. In China \u2013 where the majority of the world\u2019s ivory is consumed or stockpiled \u2013 the recently reported price is $1,100 per kilogram, putting the total value of the material to be burned at roughly $110 million.\n\nTo most economists, the idea of destroying something with so much value is anathema. But there are good reasons for a country \u2013 even one as poor as Kenya \u2013 to surrender its ivory wealth to the flames.\n\nFor starters, stockpile destruction fortifies the credibility of demand-reduction campaigns in East Asia, without which the poaching problem will never be solved. Demand reduction aims to weaken the market for the product by changing consumer tastes. As prices drop, so does the incentive for poachers to kill elephants.\n\nWhen countries keep their stockpiles, however, they signal that they anticipate being able to sell ivory in the future. This undermines the credibility of demand-reduction efforts; if the trade is likely to be legalized one day, any stigma associated with ivory consumption will be eroded.\n\nProponents of a regulated, legal international ivory trade argue that demand-reduction efforts can coexist with a limited legitimate supply. But this line of reasoning has a dangerous weakness: It assumes that a legal cartel \u2013 one proposed model for regulating supply \u2013 would crowd out illegal suppliers by providing ivory to the market at a lower cost.\n\nThis assumption is dubious at best. The quantities traded through a legal mechanism would be insufficient to flood the market and suppress the price. Indeed, with legalized trade undermining demand-reduction efforts, the price of ivory is likely to remain high, ensuring that poaching continues.\n\nSome southern African countries argue that they should be allowed to sell their ivory in CITES-permitted, one-off sales to fund conservation efforts aimed at maintaining healthy elephant populations. But, aside from the low probability in some countries that the revenue would be directed to that end, it is not clear that much money would be made.\n\nUnder CITES regulations, governments are permitted to sell only to other governments. But what other governments are willing to pay may be as low as one-tenth of the illicit value. And even then, governments can sell only naturally accrued ivory, not what was confiscated from poachers or illicit dealers.\n\nChina and the United States are in the process of formulating bans on domestic ivory trade, so it is not clear which governments would be interested in purchasing African stockpiles. Vietnam and Laos are likely candidates, but they are also part of the infamous \u201cgolden triangle,\u201d where illegal trade in wildlife and wildlife products continues to thrive. The possibility of the legal ivory trade shifting to poorly regulated markets calls for a concerted international response, spearheaded by African governments through coalitions like the Elephant Protection Initiative, together with countries such as China.\n\nPreserving \u2013 rather than burning \u2013 stockpiles is the inefficient choice. Maintaining a stockpile is administratively and operationally expensive \u2013 and often pointless. Inventory management is labor-intensive and technologically demanding. The ivory also must be air-conditioned to prevent the tusks from cracking or becoming brittle (important factors for attracting higher prices).\n\nGiven the low probability of being able to sell ivory in the future, the cost of storing and protecting it is unlikely to be recouped. Meanwhile, criminal syndicates need only corrupt a handful of local officials to make off with the goods.\n\nThen there are the high opportunity costs of investment in maintaining stockpiles. The scarce human and financial resources allocated toward stockpile management could be more efficiently directed toward landscape preservation efforts (which can become self-sustaining over time through payment for ecosystem services).\n\nFinally, burning ivory worth millions of dollars has an undeniable symbolic impact. It sends a clear message: Ivory belongs to elephants and to no one else. And it makes clear that elephants are worth more alive than dead.\n\nIndeed, elephants\u2019 value is anything but symbolic. Elephants are a keystone species for preserving important ecosystems. And yet rampant poaching is destroying elephant populations across Africa, killing, on average, 30,000 a year.\n\nPoaching also has a negative impact on communities, benefiting a few at the expense of the many. Recent research has shown that community conservancies (areas set aside for wildlife conservation) in northern Kenya are highly effective forms of landscape (and therefore elephant) preservation, provided the right incentives are in place. This is important because in countries like Kenya and Tanzania, the majority of wildlife exists outside formally protected areas.\n\nKenya should be commended for making a wise \u2013 and efficient \u2013 decision. Its neighbors, as well as countries farther south, should follow its example. Ideally, all range-state countries should destroy their stockpiles to overcome the regional collective action problem.

Photo: REUTERS/Siegfried Modola\nJOHANNESBURG, South Africa \u2014 Kenya recently destroyed its entire stockpile of elephant ivory. Altogether, more than 110 tons\u00a0of\u00a0\u201cwhite gold\u201d\u00a0went up in smoke. Much of what was burned was\u00a0illegally harvested ivory seized by authorities from poachers or traders. Some was ivory derived legally from the tusks of elephants who had died of natural causes.\n\nIn China \u2014 where the majority of the world\u2019s ivory is consumed or stockpiled \u2014 the most recent price is $1,100 per kilogram, or over $31 an ounce. The total value of the material Kenya burned thus comes to roughly $110 million.\n\nTo most economists, the idea of destroying something with so much value seems foolish. However, there are good reasons for a country \u2014 even one as poor as Kenya \u2014 to surrender its ivory wealth to the flames.\n\nFor starters, stockpile destruction strengthens the credibility of demand-reduction campaigns in East Asia, without which the poaching problem will never be solved. Demand reduction aims to weaken demand for ivory by changing consumer tastes. The hope is that if illegal ivory harvesting is made to seem shameful enough, then more and more people will shy away from buying ivory. A drop in demand would then lead to a drop in price. As prices dropped, so would the incentive for poachers to kill elephants.\n\nPressure To Relax The Ban\n\nToday, most countries observe a ban on the international ivory trade, first introduced in 1990. However, there is continuing pressure to relax or sidestep that ban. When African countries keep their stockpiles, they signal that they expect to be able to sell ivory in the future. This undermines the credibility of demand-reduction efforts. If people believe the trade is likely to be legalized one day, then negative views of ivory consumption will be lessened.\n\nThose in favor of a regulated, legal international ivory trade argue that demand-reduction efforts can coexist with a limited, fully legal supply.\u00a0However, this line of reasoning has a dangerous weakness: It assumes that legal dealers would crowd out illegal suppliers by providing ivory to the market at a lower cost.\n\nThis assumption is doubtful at best. The quantities traded through legal means would be insufficient to flood the market and significantly lower prices. Indeed, with legalized trade undermining demand-reduction efforts, the price of ivory is likely to remain high, ensuring that poaching continues.\n\nSome southern African countries argue that they should be allowed to sell their ivory stockpiles to fund conservation efforts aimed at maintaining healthy elephant populations. However, for some of those countries the probability is low that any money earned would really be used for that purpose. In addition, it is not clear that much money would be made to begin with.\n\nUnder regulations established by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, governments are only permitted to sell to other governments. However, what other governments are willing to pay may be as low as one-tenth of the black-market value. Even then, governments can only sell ivory taken from elephants who died of natural causes. They are not permitted to sell ivory seized from poachers or illegal dealers.\n\nInternational Response Essential\n\nChina and the United States are in the process of introducing bans on domestic ivory trade, so it is not clear which governments would be interested in purchasing African stockpiles. Vietnam and Laos are likely candidates, but they are also countries in which illegal trade in wildlife and wildlife products continues to thrive. The possibility of the legal ivory trade shifting to poorly regulated markets calls for a concerted international response. Such a response should be spearheaded by African governments through coalitions like the Elephant Protection Initiative, together with countries such as China.\n\nPreserving \u2014 rather than burning \u2014 stockpiles is the inefficient choice. Maintaining a stockpile is expensive \u2014 and often pointless. Inventory management is labor-intensive and technologically demanding. The ivory also must be air-conditioned to prevent the tusks from cracking or becoming brittle, as such flaws would greatly lower their price.\n\nGiven the low probability of being able to sell ivory in the future, the cost of storing and protecting it is unlikely to be recovered. Meanwhile, criminal gangs need only corrupt a handful of local officials to make off with the goods.\n\nFinally, burning ivory worth millions of dollars has an undeniable symbolic impact. It sends a clear message: Ivory belongs to elephants and to no one else. It also makes clear that elephants are worth more alive than dead.\n\nIndeed, elephants\u2019 value is anything but symbolic. Elephants play a vital role in preserving important ecosystems. Despite this, widespread poaching is destroying elephant populations across Africa, killing, on average, 30,000 a year.\n\nPoaching also has a negative impact on communities, as it benefits a few at the expense of the many.

On average, 30,000 African elephants are killed every year, even though they are a protected species and hunting them is against the law. Elephants are now in danger of dying out.\n\nThe magnificent animals are killed for their ivory tusks, which resemble horns but are actually huge teeth. Smooth, white ivory is fashioned into jewelry and a wide range of decorative objects. It is particularly popular in Asia.\n\nNow there is some good news for elephants. The government of Kenya has just taken a bold step that will help strengthen the fight against elephant poaching.\u00a0\n\nThe country recently destroyed its entire stockpile of elephant ivory.\u00a0\n\nAltogether, more than 110 tons\u00a0of\u00a0\u201cwhite gold\u201d\u00a0went up in smoke. Much of what was burned was seized from poachers or traders. Some was ivory legally obtained from elephants who died of natural causes.\n\nChina Tops List Of Buyers\n\nThe number-one buyer of African ivory is China. In China, ivory now costs over $31 an ounce. Based on that price, the total value of the ivory Kenya burned was roughly $110 million.\n\nIt might seem foolish to destroy something worth so much, particularly because Kenya is a poor country. However, there are good reasons for a country to give up its ivory wealth.\n\nFor starters, it helps efforts to get Asians to stop buying ivory. Various groups are working hard to educate people about the dangers elephants face. The hope is that ivory will become less popular in Asia if the ivory trade develops a bad reputation.\u00a0\n\nA drop in demand for ivory would lead to a drop in price. If prices dropped enough, poachers would no longer find it worth their while to kill elephants.\u00a0\n\nWithout such a drop in demand, the poaching problem will never be solved.\n\nBy destroying its ivory stockpile, Kenya showed the world that it values elephants over profit. It may help convince people they really should not be buying ivory.\u00a0\n\nContinued Pressure To Restore Trade\n\nToday, most countries have outlawed the international ivory trade. However, there is continuing pressure to bring the trade back.\u00a0When African countries keep their stockpiles, it signals that the countries think they will be able to sell ivory in the future. Stockpiling ivory works against efforts to get people to stop valuing ivory.\n\nSome people are in favor of legalizing the international ivory trade, as long as no poached ivory is sold. They say\u00a0legal sellers would drive out the poachers by providing ivory at a lower cost.\n\nMost likely, things would not turn out that way. The amount of legal ivory would be too small to lower prices. The legalized trade would simply help keep ivory popular.\n\nSome African countries argue that they should be allowed to sell their ivory stockpiles in order to raise money to help protect elephants. However, some countries might not really use the money for that purpose. In addition, they probably would not be able to earn that much.\n\nUnder international law, governments can only sell ivory to other governments. Most governments would only be willing to pay around one-tenth of what ivory can go for. In addition, governments can only sell ivory taken from elephants who were not poached.\u00a0\n\nCheaper Than Preservation\n\nIt is also not clear which governments would be interested in buying African stockpiles.\u00a0China and the United States may soon outlaw the sale of ivory. Vietnam and Laos would probably be interested, but many would be against selling to them. Neither has been good at following international laws meant to protect endangered wildlife.\n\nBurning an ivory stockpile is also cheaper than preserving it. For one thing, the ivory must be air-conditioned to prevent the tusks from cracking. A large number of workers would be needed to care for the ivory.\u00a0Meanwhile, there is always the danger that criminal gangs would get ahold of the goods by paying an official to look the other way.\u00a0\n\nMost importantly, burning ivory worth millions of dollars sends a clear and strong message to the world. It says that ivory belongs to elephants and to no one else. It also makes clear that elephants are worth more alive than dead. They bring tourists, and help keep the natural world healthy and balanced.\n\nKenya should be praised for making such a wise decision. Other African countries should follow its example and destroy their own stockpiles.

It proved it cares more about elephants than money.\u00a0\n\nKenya's bold move may help change the way people think. It could make more people realize they should not buy ivory.\u00a0\n\nGetting people to stop wanting ivory is the most important thing. Poaching will never end until that happens.\n\nToday, most countries no longer allow people to buy ivory from Africa. However, some people keep trying to get around the laws.\u00a0\n\nFew People Want To Buy\n\nWhen African countries store ivory, it sends a bad message. It shows they think they will be able to sell it in the future. Storing ivory makes it harder to get people to stop wanting ivory.\n\nSome African countries say they should be allowed to sell their ivory. They say they would use the money to help protect elephants. However, many worry that some of these countries might really use the money for other things.\u00a0\n\nAlso, they probably would not be able to earn that much money anyway.\n\nFirst of all, they would not have that much to sell. They would only be allowed to sell ivory taken from elephants who were not poached.\n\nSecondly, governments can only sell ivory to other governments. Most governments would not be willing to pay very much. They would probably only pay around one-tenth of what ivory usually goes for.\n\nIt could also be hard to find any buyers.

People have thousands of genes that tell their bodies how to work. We share genes with many other living things.\n\nSome plants and animals do not have as many genes as people. Some are very simple.\u00a0\n\nJ. Craig Venter is a scientist. He studies living things. He has been trying to find out how many genes a living thing needs to stay alive.\n\nTry And Try Again\n\nVenter and his team made the most simple organism\u00a0in the world. It has fewer genes than any other living thing. It is a simple cell.\n\nIt was not easy to make this simple being. He tried and failed many times. At first\u00a0he thought he knew all the genes a living thing needed to stay alive. He was wrong.\n\nInstead, he had to learn from something that was already alive. He decided to work with a bacterium. A bacterium is a very simple organism. It has the fewest genes of any living thing.\n\nCounting Genes\n\nHis team\u00a0picked apart the living thing. They wanted to see what it was made of. They split its genes into eight pieces. Then they took away genes that they did not think the living thing needed. If the organism started to die, they put those genes back in.\u00a0\n\nThey learned that the tiny creature needed 473 genes to live.\n\nTheir test showed that we know very little about the building blocks of life.\u00a0Venter's organism needs\u00a0473 genes to stay healthy. Genes make proteins and tell it to grow. Yet there are 149 genes that no one is sure what they do. We do not know the jobs of this one-third of the other genes that the organism needed to live. We still have much to learn.\n\nScientists Have More Gene Work To Do\n\nVenter wants to make new things out of genes from living beings. Scientists will soon make more complicated living things.\u00a0\n\nBut it is not so simple. Genes do not work alone. They work together, like people living in a village.

Photo: REUTERS/Larry Downing\nImagine for a moment that you have come across a trove of marvelous devices left by an ancient civilization. These mysterious instruments vary widely in size and complexity, but they all share a few wondrous capabilities.\n\nIf you want to understand how they work, it makes sense to start with the simplest and smallest device, then systematically carve off pieces until it stops working. Eventually, everything that is inessential will be gone, and you will be left with only the parts necessary for it to perform its basic functions. And then, once you figure out what each of those pieces does, you will have your answer.\n\nThis is roughly the journey of discovery that the American biotechnologist J. Craig Venter and his co-workers have been taking for the past two decades. Except their marvelous devices are not archeological remains, but living creatures. The pieces they are trying to understand are the genes that we share with all other forms of independent, reproductive life.\n\nIntroducing The Simple Cell\n\nIn a recent paper in the journal Science, Venter and his co-workers announced that they had created the smallest living organism that can also reproduce itself. They created a simple cell, with only the genes that are essential for life. It has a smaller genome than any natural being that replicates itself. It is larger only than those found in viruses and other living things that rely on hosts for essential functions.\n\nVenter and his team created their organism through a process of trial and error. They began by using their knowledge of biology \u2014 the science of living things \u2014 to deduce the minimum set of genes that would be required for life. That approach failed.\n\nSo, instead, they took an existing being and began to whittle it down. They started with the genome of Mycoplasma mycoides, a parasitic bacteria that infects cattle and goats. It has the fewest genes, just 525, known among free-living bacteria.\n\nThe team broke the M.mycoides genome into eight fragments and began deleting genes one by one. If the reconstructed being failed to thrive,\u00a0the gene was left in. If it did not appear to matter, it stayed out. In the end, 473 genes were required for the being to thrive. Humans, by comparison, have roughly 20,000 genes.\n\nThere Is More To Basic Biology\n\nThe most important result of the Venter team\u2019s work was to reveal how little we know about the basic biology of life. Most of the 473 genes take care of housekeeping: They make proteins, keep DNA in good repair, and are responsible for the cell\u2019s membrane and cytoplasm. But there are 149 genes whose function is unknown. In other words, the purpose of nearly one-third of the genes needed to keep the living thing alive, well, and reproducing remains a mystery.\n\nOf the 149 genes with unknown functions, 70 have a structure that at least hints at their role in the cell. But we know nothing about the other 79, except that in these beings, in this environment, life is impossible without them. Moreover, as Venter and his coworkers acknowledge, if the team began with a different microbe, or grew it in a different environment, the set of necessary genes would be different. So their genome is a minimal genome, not the minimal genome.\n\nAll of this implies many exciting discoveries ahead. And yet, when it comes to practical, commercial objectives, the news is considerably more sobering.\n\nGenome Building Blocks\n\nOne of the primary goals of artificial biology has been to create a platform to use as a foundation for building beings designed for specific tasks.\u00a0\n\nCar companies use a single platform to build 19 completely different vehicles, from luxury cars to SUVs. A biological platform would serve a similar purpose. It would be \u00a0a simple frame on which could be bolted instructions to make drugs, biofuels, makeup or whatever one desires.\n\nWith the publication of the Science paper, two challenges become evident. The first is that the study of living things is complicated. As Venter\u2019s work shows, we do not yet have a sufficient grasp of the fundamentals of basic biology to design and build a cell. Genes do not function like fenders or brakes; they cannot be mounted on a frame to perform a function independently of other parts. Genes interact \u2014 amplifying, dampening, or even silencing one another. And those effects, in turn, influence still other genes.\n\nGenomes, it turns out, function less like machines than like ecosystems with infinite relationships and complicated feedback loops. Adding genomic parts to an artificial being to achieve a predictable result may be far more difficult than proponents of this model have assumed.\n\nMore Gene-Editing Challenges Ahead\n\nThe second challenge regards the competition. When Venter and his team began their effort, genetic engineers had tools that were powerful but, by modern standards, crude. In recent years, scientists have found ways to edit genes with far greater precision. The most prominent, known as CRISPR Cas9, cuts DNA with remarkable - though not perfect - accuracy. As a result, gene editing has emerged as an alternative to his model for tailoring microbes to make useful products.\n\nIt is impossible to know whether artificial beings or gene-editing tools will prove to be profitable in biotechnology. Another method could replace them both.\u00a0\n\nWe can be confident, however, that our knowledge of science will deepen. Our growing ability to control living beings will force us to make increasingly serious moral choices.\n\nThomas H.

As a result, gene editing has emerged as an alternative strategy to the chassis model for tailoring microbes to make useful products.\n\nIt is impossible to know whether synthetic organisms like Venter\u2019s JCVI-syn 3.0 or gene-editing techniques will prove to be commercially dominant in biotechnology \u2013 or indeed whether some other method will supplant both. We can be confident, however, that our knowledge of basic biology will deepen, and that our growing ability to manipulate living organisms will confront us with increasingly serious ethical considerations.\n\nThomas H.

Photo: REUTERS/Larry Downing\nImagine for a moment that you have come across a treasure chest of amazing tools left by an ancient civilization. These mysterious instruments come in many different sizes and levels of complexity. Still, they all share a few wondrous powers.\n\nTo understand how they work, you have to start with the simplest and smallest device. You can carve off pieces until it stops working. Eventually, everything that is not essential will be gone, and you will be left with only the parts that are necessary for it to perform its most simple tasks. Soon, you will figure out what each piece does.\u00a0\n\nThis is roughly the journey of discovery that the American scientist J. Craig Venter and his coworkers have taken for the past 20 years. Venter is a technobiologist. He makes new products from living things. He is trying to figure out how many genes it takes to keep an organism alive.\n\nSimple Cell Success\n\nVenter and his coworkers recently announced that they had created the smallest living thing that can also reproduce. They created a simple cell, with only the genes that are essential for life. It has a smaller number of genes and DNA than any natural being that replicates itself.\u00a0\n\nVenter and his team created their organism through a process of trial and error. They began by using their knowledge of biology \u2014 the science of living things \u2014 to deduce the smallest set of genes that would be required for life. That approach failed.\u00a0\n\nThen his team tried a different approach by taking an existing organism and whittling it down. They started with the genome of Mycoplasma mycoides, a parasitic bacteria that infects cattle and goats. It is the bacteria with the fewest genes.\n\nThe team broke the genome into eight pieces and began deleting genes one by one. If the reconstructed organism failed to thrive, the gene was left in. If it did not appear to matter, it stayed out. In the end, 473 genes were required for the organism to thrive. Humans, by comparison, have roughly 20,000 genes.\n\nIdentifying Mystery Genes\n\nThe most important result of Venter's work was to show how little we know about the simple science of life. Most of the 473 genes take care of housekeeping. They make proteins, keep DNA in good repair, and are responsible for the cell\u2019s membrane and cytoplasm. But there are 149 genes whose purposes are unknown. In other words, the purpose of nearly one-third of the genes needed to keep the living thing alive, well and reproducing remains a mystery.\n\nSeventy of the 149 genes have a structure that at least hints at what they are for. We know nothing about the other 79, except that the organism cannot live without them. But the team's genome set is only one of many combinations. If the team began with a different microbe, or grew it in a different place, the set of necessary genes would be different.\u00a0\n\nAll of this implies many exciting discoveries ahead. And yet, when it comes to practical goals, like what businesses would use the technology for, the news is a reason for careful thought.\n\nScience Of Creating\n\nArtificial biology is the science of creating new things out of living beings. One of its main goals is to build a gene platform that can be used as\u00a0a foundation to build beings designed for certain tasks.\u00a0\n\nCar companies often use a single platform to build different cars. For instance, Volkswagen uses a single frame to build 19 completely different vehicles. A biological platform would serve a similar purpose. It would be a simple frame on which could be bolted instructions to make drugs, fuels, makeup or whatever you want.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of challenges. Studying living things is complicated. As Venter\u2019s work shows, we do not yet have a sufficient grasp of the simple science to design and build a cell. Genes do not work independently. They interact \u2014 amplifying, dampening, or even silencing one another. Those effects, in turn, influence still other genes.\n\nBiology Lab's New Technology\n\nGenomes, it turns out, act less like machines than like communities. They have several complicated relationships. Adding genomic parts to an artificial organism to achieve a predictable result might be far more difficult than supporters of this model thought.\n\nNewer technology is changing the way we study genomes. We can be confident, however, that our knowledge of science will deepen. Our growing ability to control living beings will force us to make increasingly serious moral choices.\n\nThomas H.

Murray, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n05.06.16\n\nA scientist works in the laboratory at the J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland, March 29, 2010. Photo: REUTERS/Larry Downing\nGenes are the building blocks of life. A gene contains information about who you are, like the color of your hair and eyes. It tells the rest of your body how to work. We share genes with many other living things. Humans have thousands of complicated genes. Many plants and animals have simpler sets of genes.\u00a0\n\nJ. Craig Venter is a biologist. He is a scientist who studies living things, like plants, animals and other creatures. For 20 years, Venter has tried to figure out how many genes a living thing needs to stay alive.\u00a0\n\nTo figure it out, he and his team created the smallest living thing in the world. It only has the genes that it needs to stay alive. The creature, or organism, they created has fewer genes than any other in the world.\n\nSorting Genes, One By One\n\nThey created this tiny creature by trying and failing many times. At first, they tried to put together\u00a0the genes they thought were the most important to keep living things alive. That did not work.\u00a0\n\nInstead, they decided to work with a living thing that already existed. They chose to work with a bacterium. A bacterium is the simplest creature in the world. The one they chose infects cows and goats and makes them sick.\u00a0\n\nThey picked it apart to see what genes the creature was made of.\u00a0The team broke the genes into eight pieces. They began deleting genes one by one. Every time they deleted a gene, they checked on the organism to see how it was doing. If it started dying, they put the gene back in.\u00a0\n\nIn the end, they found out that the\u00a0organism\u00a0needed 473 genes to live. They created a simple cell.\n\nWorking On A Gene Platform\n\nThe test showed that we know very little about the building blocks of life. Most of the 473 genes in the\u00a0organism\u00a0help to keep it healthy. They make proteins and tell the creature\u00a0to grow. But there are 149 genes whose jobs are unknown. We still do not know much about this one-third of the other genes that the creature needed to live. We have much to discover.\u00a0\n\nVenter wants to make new things out of genes from living creatures.\u00a0He is trying to make a gene platform.\u00a0It would work\u00a0almost\u00a0like a white piece of paper. Anyone could write\u00a0on it. Other scientists could use the platform to make any creatures they want.\n\nCar companies use platforms. They make a metal frame. Then they build different types of cars from the same frame. Volkswagen builds 19 different cars from one of its frames.\u00a0Venter's platform would be used in the same way as the car base. It would be a frame where you could\u00a0put the building blocks to make medicine, makeup or whatever you want.\n\nGenes Prefer Company Of Others\n\nBut building genes is not so simple as building cars. Genes do not work alone. They work together, like people living in a village. When you change one gene, you are changing the way it works with other genes.\n\nNew technology is changing the way scientists study genes. As we understand them more deeply, we will have to make some important decisions about how to control living things.\n\nThomas H.

Photo: AP/Ahn Young-joon\nFor the very first time, a computer program defeated a champion player of the game called Go.\n\nLee Sedol is one of the world\u2019s top-ranked players of Go. It is an ancient and very difficult game invented in China. Sedol lost a five-game tournament by a score of 4-1 to a computer program specially designed to play Go. It is called AlphaGo.\u00a0\n\nWhy is that news? Nearly 20 years ago, the IBM computer Deep Blue defeated the world chess champion. Deep Blue won through its strong computing power. It figured the outcomes of more moves to a deeper level than even a world champion can.\u00a0\n\nComputers have improved since then.\u00a0Go is even more difficult than chess. It is played on a far larger board. It has 19-by-19 squares, compared with 8-by-8 squares for chess. Deep Blue also won in a different way. It played games over and over, and learned from them.\n\nCan Artificial Intelligence Machines Think Like A Human?\n\nThe AlphaGo program's victory is another example of how smart computers have become. Computers and computer programs able to think on their own are examples of artificial intelligence (AI).\u00a0\n\nBut can AI machines act ethically, meaning can they be honest and fair?\n\nOne example of AI is a driverless car. They are already on California roads, so it is not too soon to ask whether we can program a machine to act ethically. As\u00a0driverless\u00a0cars improve,\u00a0they will save lives. They will make fewer mistakes than human drivers do. Sometimes, however, they will face a choice between lives. Should the cars be programmed to avoid hitting a child running across the road, even if that will put their passengers at risk? What about swerving to avoid a dog? What if the only risk is damage to the car itself, not to the passengers?\n\nPerhaps there will be lessons to learn from driverless cars, but they are not superintelligent beings. Teaching ethics to a machine even more intelligent than we will be the bigger challenge.\n\nCan We Turn Off Superintelligent Machines?\n\nThere are other concerns about AI. Nick Bostrom wrote the book Superintelligence. He defines superintelligence as an intellect that is smarter than the best human brains in practically every way. He says it may not be easy to turn off a superintelligent machine. They may be able to outsmart our attempts to turn them off, he says.\n\nStill, some scientists doubt superintelligence will ever be achieved.\n\nAbout the same time as AlphaGo\u2019s triumph, Microsoft\u2019s \u201cchatbot\u201d\u00a0took a bad turn.\u00a0The\u00a0Microsoft software, named Taylor, was designed to answer messages from people ages 18 to 24. Taylor was supposed to be able to learn from the messages she received. She was designed to slowly improve her ability to handle conversations, but some people were teaching Taylor racist ideas. When she started saying nice things about Hitler, Microsoft turned her off and deleted her ugliest messages.\n\nAlphaGo\u2019s victory and Taylor\u2019s defeat happened at about the same time. This should be a warning to us. It is one thing to use AI within a game with clear rules and clear goals. It is something very different to use AI in the real world. The unpredictability of the real world may bring to the surface a troubling software problem.\u00a0\n\nEric Schmidt is one of the bosses of Google, which owns AlphaGo. He thinks AI will be positive for humans. He said people will be the winner, whatever the outcome. Advances in AI will make every human being smarter, more able and \u201cjust better human beings.\u201d\n\nPeter Singer is Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University in New Jersey and Laureate Professor at the University of Melbourne, Australia.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "1140L": "Opinion: Ethics plays an important role in artificial intelligence\nBy Peter Singer, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n05.02.16\n\nTV screens show the live broadcast of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match between Google's artificial intelligence program, AlphaGo, and South Korean professional Go player Lee Sedol, at the Yongsan Electronic store in Seoul, South Korea, March 15, 2016.

Unfortunately, within 24 hours, people were teaching Tay racist and sexist ideas.

Either way, AlphaGo\u2019s victory and Taylor\u2019s defeat occurring at about the same time serves as a warning. It is one thing to unleash AI within a game with specific rules and a clear goal. It is something very different to release AI into the real world, where the unpredictability of the environment may reveal a software error that has disastrous consequences.\n\nNick Bostrom is director of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University. He argues in his book Superintelligence that it will not always be as easy to turn off an intelligent machine as it was to turn off Tay. He defines superintelligence as an intellect that is \u201csmarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills.\u201d Such a system may be able to outsmart our attempts to turn it off.\n\nSome doubt that superintelligence will ever be achieved.

The median estimates\u00a0\u2013\u00a0or the middle value in a list of numbers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for the 1 in 2 chance were in the 2040-2050 range. For the 9 in 10 chance, it is 2075. Most experts expected that AI would achieve superintelligence within 30 years of achieving human-level intelligence.\n\nSuperintelligence Still A Distant Issue, But Worth Thinking About\n\nWe should not take these estimates too seriously. Only 31 percent of the scientists that were surveyed responded. The researchers who did respond work in AI and have an incentive to boost the importance of their field by trumpeting its potential to produce impressive results.\n\nThe prospect of AI achieving superintelligence may seem too distant to worry about, especially given more pressing problems. But there is a case to be made for starting to think about how we can design AI to take into account the interests of humans, and indeed of all sentient beings. That would include\u00a0machines, if they are also conscious beings with interests of their own.\n\nWith driverless cars already on California roads, it is not too soon to ask whether we can program a machine to act ethically.

Photo: REUTERS/Brian Snyder\nThe Black Lives Matter movement declares that police and criminal courts treat African-American people unfairly. The activist group has drawn the nation's attention to the stories of African-American men killed by police. Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and other victims have become symbols of discrimination in the United States.\n\nBut in a bold new book, \"Pushout: The Criminalization of Black Girls in Schools,\" the researcher and activist Monique W. Morris argues that discrimination toward African-American women is often ignored.\u00a0That's why she begins her book by talking about a 14-year-old girl named Dajerria Becton. Last year, Becton was tackled to the ground by a police officer in McKinney, Texas. The officer, who was caught on camera, was forced to resign.\n\nThe way African-American girls are treated like criminals is not just a problem in the streets, Morris writes.\u00a0\"It has extended into our schools, disrupting one of the most important protective factors in a girl's life: her education.\"\n\nSchools Ignore Unique Needs\n\nMorris has spent more than 20 years studying how race and education affect the challenges of being a girl. She's a former vice president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored\u00a0 People (NAACP). This group fights for equal rights for African-Americans. She's also a former college professor. For this book, she spent four years studying how discrimination in U.S. public schools and the criminal justice system affects African-American girls. As part of her research, she interviewed young women between 15 and 23.\n\nUltimately, she finds that too many schools ignore the unique needs and challenges of African-American girls.\u00a0As a result, she says, all African-American girls are treated the same way and are punished in ways that only create more problems. Indeed, African-American girls represented 50.7 percent of the girls who received more than one school suspension in 2013. By contrast, African-American boys made up 39.9 percent of boys with more than one suspension.\n\nThe differences begin at a very young age.\u00a0Today, African-American children make up 18 percent of all preschool children. However, they make up more than 40 percent of the preschool children who have been suspended. Between 2002 and 2006, suspension rates for African-American girls increased by three times more than they did for African-American boys.\n\nPushed Out Of Education\n\nMorris argues that African-American girls are unfairly punished at higher rates than white girls. She believes this is because some people have racist ideas about African-American women's behavior. The title of her book refers to the way girls are \"pushed out\" of the public education system.\n\nTo understand Morris's approach, it is important to understand the idea of \"intersectionality.\" This means that people have more than one way that they see themselves. Different factors, such as race, class and whether you are a boy or a girl, affect your experience. Sometimes these factors come together, creating new and unique challenges. In this case, Morris writes, challenges faced by African-American girls are different from challenges faced by white girls and African-American boys.\n\nMorris argues that teachers often misunderstand how African-American girls act. Teachers often think the girls are showing \"attitude.\" She says, though, that the \"attitude\" they see is actually a response to bad treatment and suffering in their lives.\n\nTeachers Can Add To Harm\n\nShe writes about a California student named Malaika who has been suspended from school many times, beginning in first grade. Malaika believes that the classroom is a place where she is encouraged to point out things that are wrong but then is punished for doing so. \"They're always telling us to voice our opinions,\" she tells Morris. \"But then when we voice our opinion, we're going to get in trouble. So that's irritating.\"\n\nMorris also says schools fail to address an alarming fact. African-American girls are more likely to be victims of sexual violence, she says.\n\nAfrican-American girls' suffering follows them into the classroom. Some of the girls Morris interviewed found it difficult to participate in daily school activities. At school, Morris writes, their bodies are looked at, touched and talked about in ways that make them feel self-conscious. Some teachers make the problem worse by punishing girls for wearing certain clothes.\n\nApplying Different Rules\n\nOne California student named Deja spoke about a time she was told to go home because she was wearing a pair of shorts. It was a particularly warm day, she said. Deja said that while she was in the office, a white girl wearing similar clothes walked in and was given a pass to class. Deja pointed out that the white girl's shorts were shorter than hers. She was then allowed to go to class.\u00a0On Deja's way out, an administrator accused her of wearing inappropriate clothes to attract attention from boys.\n\nMorris argues that Deja was kept from class because the school was afraid she would distract her male classmates, while her white classmate was ignored. This fear is based in racist ideas about African-American women, Morris writes.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: The criminalization of black girls\nBy Alex Laughlin, Washington Post\n04.28.16\n\nA young girl holds a sign at a protest against police violence in Boston, Massachusetts, April 29, 2015. Photo: REUTERS/Brian Snyder\nAs the Black Lives Matter movement and protests in Ferguson and Baltimore have seized the nation's attention, the names and stories of black men and boys, like Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, have become synonymous with the discrimination that continues to face African-Americans in the United States today.\n\nBut in a provocative new book, \"Pushout: The Criminalization of Black Girls in Schools,\" the academic and activist Monique W. Morris argues that too often discrimination faced by black women, particularly black girls in school, is overlooked. That's why she begins her book by recounting not one of those famous police confrontations with young black men but another one involving 14-year-old Dajerria Becton, who was tackled to the ground by a police officer at school last year outside a pool party in McKinney, Texas. The officer, who was caught on camera, was forced to resign.\n\n\"The criminalization of Black girls is much more than a street phenomenon,\" Morris writes. \"It has extended into our schools, disrupting one of the most important protective factors in a girl's life: her education.\"\n\nMorris has spent more than 20 years working at the intersection of gender, race and education. She's the former vice president for economic programs, advocacy and research at the NAACP and a former college professor. For this book, she spent four years researching how race and gender-based discrimination in U.S. public schools and criminal justice systems in six big cities, from San Francisco to New York, affects black girls - in part by interviewing young women ages 15 to 23.\n\nUltimately, she concludes that too many schools are not sensitive to the unique needs and challenges of black girls. As a result, she says, schools treat all black girls the same way, enforcing punitive disciplinary policies that send far too many into the juvenile justice system. Indeed, black girls represented 50.7 percent of the girls with multiple out-of-school suspensions in 2013, according to the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights. By contrast, black boys made up 39.9 percent of boys with multiple out-of-school suspensions.\n\nAnd the disparities begin at a very young age. \"Today, Black children are 18 percent of preschool enrollment but 42 percent of preschool-age children who have had one out-of-school suspension,\" Morris writes. \"[B]etween 2002 and 2006, per-district suspension rates of Black girls increased by 5.3 percent compared to a 1.7 percent increase for Black boys.\"\n\nBlack girls are punished at much higher rates, Morris argues, because stereotypes about black femininity are widely accepted as true. (The title of the book refers to the systems through which girls are \"pushed out\" of the public education system because of disciplinary policies.)\n\nTo understand Morris's approach, it is important to step back and understand the concept of \"intersectionality,\" an idea popular in feminist academic literature that holds that people's multiple identities - race, class, gender, sexuality - can intersect to create broader vulnerabilities. In this case, Morris writes, intersectionality means that a black girl experiences the disadvantages of being female compounded with the experience of being a racial minority.\n\nMorris argues that educators too often apply stereotypes to the behaviors of black girls, assuming a certain \"attitude.\" She says, though, that the perceived \"attitude\" is actually a kind of response to \"disrespectful or degrading triggers in their lives - many of which were present in their learning environments.\"\n\nBy way of example, she profiles a Bay Area student named Malaika (a pseudonym) who had routinely experienced suspension since she was in first grade. Malaika's perception is that the classroom is a place where she is encouraged to point out things that are wrong - but then is punished for it. \"They're always telling us to voice our opinions,\" she tells Morris. \"But then when we voice our opinion, we're going to get in trouble. So that's irritating.\"\n\nShe gives an example of a time she believed she was standing up for herself, but she was ultimately punished for her behavior. She was reprimanded for talking in class, and her teacher began yelling at her: \"I told my teacher . . . 'You're yelling at me and I don't want you yelling at me,'\" Malaika said. The situation escalated, and Malaika ended up having to work in the principal's office for three days. Malaika felt she was being treated disrespectfully when she tried to \"speak her truth,\" Morris writes.\n\nMorris also says schools fail to respond appropriately to the fact that black girls face higher levels of sexual victimization both inside and outside the classroom. About 19 percent of black girls are sexually assaulted or trafficked, which is \"among the highest for any group in the nation,\" Morris writes, citing a study by the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network.\n\nThe trauma of this victimization can follow girls into the classroom, where Morris interviewed girls who found it difficult to participate in the daily activities required in school because \"in the hallways, in the classrooms . . . Black girls describe conditions in which their bodies are scrutinized, touched (often without their permission), and objectified in ways that make them feel self-conscious and constantly defensive,\" Morris writes. That scrutiny of black girls' bodies also extends to the teachers and administrators, who discipline girls based on their clothes and adherence to dress codes.\n\nMorris interviewed one California student named Deja who talked about a time she was told to go home because she was wearing a pair of shorts on a hot day. She said while she was in the office, a white girl wearing similar clothes walked in and was given a pass to class without comment. After putting up a fight with administrators and pointing out that the white girl's shorts were shorter than hers, Deja was given a pass to class. Deja said the administrator said to her, \"'I'm going to give you a pass this one time, but please don't be letting the boys feel all on you and stuff.'\"\n\nMorris argues that Deja was kept from class out of a fear that her exposed body would distract her male classmates, while her white classmate was overlooked.

They do not let the country forget the names of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and 12-year-old Tamir Rice, black males who have been killed by police.

The officer was caught on camera and forced to quit his job.\n\nMany black girls are treated like they are going to break the law. It is not just a problem in the streets, Morris writes. The problem is also in our schools, a place that should protect them.\n\nInterviews With Young Women\n\nMorris has spent many years studying race, education and the challenges of being a girl. She used to work for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The group that fights for equal rights for African-Americans. For her book, she studied how discrimination in U.S. public schools affects black girls. As part of her study, she interviewed young women.\n\nShe concludes that too many schools ignore the needs and challenges of black girls.\u00a0As a result, they treat all black girls the same way.\u00a0Too many schools punish them before they even do anything wrong. This only creates more problems.\n\nThe differences begin at a very young age. Black children in preschool are more likely to be suspended than white children. Black girls are also more likely to be suspended than black boys. When a child is suspended, he or she has to stay home from school at least a day for bad behavior.\n\nIdeas About How Black Women Act\n\nMorris argues that black girls are treated unfairly. She thinks this is because some people have racist ideas about how black women act. The title of her book is about the ways that girls are \"pushed out\" of public schools.\n\nMorris says that different qualities affect your life. These qualities can be the color of your skin or whether you are a boy or a girl.\u00a0Sometimes these qualities come together to create additional challenges for a person. Black girls face challenges that are different from those that white girls and black boys face. They may be treated unfairly because they are female and black.\n\nMorris argues that teachers often do not understand how black girls act. They think the girls are acting a certain way because they do not like school. Morris says the girls are just acting that way because of suffering in their lives.\n\nEven Clothes Are An Issue\n\nShe writes about a student named Malaika who has been in trouble at school since she was in first grade.

Deja pointed out that the white girl's shorts were shorter than hers.

Photo: REUTERS/Brian Snyder\nIn the news lately, there have been many stories about police and black Americans. There is a group called Black Lives Matter. They believe that black people in America are treated unfairly. They were driven to action by a few killings by police. Police shot and killed Michael Brown. He was 18 years old. They killed 9-year-old Tamir Rice. \u00a0Both Michael and Tamir did not have weapons. Police said they thought both did have weapons. They felt unsafe.\n\nMany of the Black Lives Matter protests focus on black men and boys. One author named Monique W. Morris says black women and girls are also treated unfairly. She\u00a0wrote a book called \"Pushout: The Criminalization of Black Girls in Schools.\" She starts her book with a story about a girl. Her name is Dajerria Becton, and she is 14 years old. Last year, a policeman pushed Dajerria to the ground. He was caught on camera. After people saw the video, he lost his job.\n\nMorris says many black girls are treated badly like this. Morris says that this is a big problem in schools. At school, children should feel protected. Instead, black girls feel like they are under attack.\n\nMore Likely To Be Punished\n\nMorris studies how schools treat some students unfairly. For this book, she wrote about black girls. She spoke to young women.\n\nShe found that many schools do not understand black girls.\u00a0The schools act like all black girls are\u00a0all the same.\u00a0Too many schools punish black girls before they do anything wrong.\n\nBlack girls are also more likely to be punished than black boys.\n\nMorris thinks this is because some people have bad ideas about black women. They think black women act in a certain way. When black girls say or do something, their teachers might take it the wrong way. A girl might say something in class. She might think she is standing up for herself. Her teacher might think she is being disrespectful. Morris says these ideas cause teachers to treat black girls badly. The girls are pushed out of their schools.\n\nJudging Girls' Behavior\n\nTo understand Morris's book, it is important to know that it can be hard to be a girl. It can also be hard being black. A black girl will have a harder time than a black boy or a white girl, she says.\n\nMorris writes that many teachers do not understand the way black girls act. Teachers think the girls act a certain way because they do not like school. Morris says this is wrong. Some girls act a certain way because of other reasons.

Photo: Wikipedia\nPRO: Traffic-free zones would clear the air and be safer\nThe record is clear. Banning motor vehicles has made working and living in city centers much more enjoyable. Without the\u00a0carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide that the vehicles let out,\u00a0commuters no longer gag on harmful fumes while rushing to and from work.\n\nLess traffic means that workers spend less time sitting idly in their cars and more time boosting their productivity in the workplace.\n\nRecent studies show that turning city centers into traffic-free zones also gives workers more time to visit downtown businesses during their lunch hours and breaks.\n\nAnd city residents find such environments, free of blaring car horns and other nuisances, much more enjoyable.\n\nNo longer do pedestrians fear being hit by cars, a change of special importance to families who opt to raise children in downtown areas.\n\nFurthermore, workers and residents of central business districts who travel by bicycle experience a multitude of health benefits.\n\nAll in all, there is hardly any downside to imposing vehicle bans in downtown areas.\n\nTransit Systems Need More Government Money\n\nBut more support is in order. Mass transit desperately needs more government money in the form of financing.\n\nWashington, D.C.'s Metro system is the nation's most jarring example of that need. It has massive safety problems that cause daily delays and sometimes days of shutdowns for repairs. In addition, there are almost daily reports of its passengers being beaten and robbed.\n\nThe system\u00a0needs a major injection of tax dollars. Adding a new transit tax of 5 percent on people in big city metro areas would go a long way toward solving this problem.\n\nWith new revenue flowing in, following the examples of enlightened European cities would be possible.\n\nBans On Cars Successful In Europe\n\nLast year, Oslo, the bustling capital of Norway, began banning some of the estimated 350,000 cars that jammed its central business district each day.\n\nAnd presto! There was a marked improvement in quality of life, worker productivity, and sales for downtown shops and restaurants.\n\nAs a result, Oslo plans to ban all cars from its city center by 2019.\u00a0\n\nCopenhagen, the capital of Denmark, was the first city to experiment with a car ban. From a partial ban in 1962, Copenhagen quickly became a shining model for other cities.\n\nIts central thoroughfare, transformed from a traffic-clogged street to a pedestrian walkway with designated bike trails, is now one of the major tourist\u00a0attractions\u00a0in Europe.\n\nEven California, where a car was once considered an absolute necessity, has recognized the benefits of traffic-free downtown zones.\n\nChange has obviously begun. Car-free city centers are on the way! Their time has come.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Wayne Madsen is a progressive commentator whose articles have appeared in leading newspapers throughout the U.S. and Europe. Readers may write him at 415 Choo Choo Lane, Valrico, FL 33594.\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers. Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of Tribune or Newsela.\nCON: Mass transit costs too much and can't work as well\n\"Take back our streets!\" is a common refrain among city activists.\n\nNo, they're not talking about reducing violent crime, as many of them reside in well-off neighborhoods. What they want to take city streets back from is cars, which they see as a plague that lowers their quality of life. But the alternatives they propose are much more costly and provide far fewer benefits.\n\nWhen mass transit use decreased in the 1970s, anti-car activists succeeded in distorting government transportation funding to greatly advantage transit systems over highways.\n\nToday, even though more than 90 percent of households have cars, governments spend 28 percent of the nation's transportation funds on transit, with most of that money coming from state and federal fuel taxes as well as local property taxes. Yet, despite this government gravy train, transit's market share is lower than it was in 1980.\n\nAccess To Cars Expands Job Options\n\nThe myth that mass transit can serve most people does more than just waste taxpayer funds. Reducing access to cars contributes to unemployment and poverty.\n\nIn New York City, where 40 percent of all U.S. transit trips occur and where one-third of the residents take transit to work, only 15 percent of jobs are accessible by transit in less than an hour.\u00a0\n\nIn contrast, New Yorkers with cars can access more than five times as many jobs in 60 minutes. New Yorkers dependent on transit suffer from the longest commutes in America \u2013 even longer than New York drivers.\n\nWhen cities such as Chicago, Philadelphia and Sacramento converted streets to pedestrian-only areas in the 1960s and '70s in an attempt to revive their downtowns, customers stopped coming and businesses closed.\n\nAuto Pollution And Safety Risks Are Low\n\nEnvironmental activists claim automobiles should be banned to curb air pollution, but that's not quite right.

Photo: Wikipedia\nPRO: Car-free city centers are an ode to the joy of urban living\nThe record is clear. Cities that have eliminated automobiles from their central business districts have improved not only their air quality but also the overall livability of their crowded center areas.\n\nAnd the corresponding increased use of public transportation has given subways, trams, monorails and buses running on clean-burning natural gas a new lease on life.\n\nThe banning of motor vehicles that belch carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide gases has made working and living in city centers much more enjoyable for commuters, who no longer gag on diesel and other noxious fumes while rushing to and from work.\n\nThe lack of traffic-jammed streets means workers spend far less time sitting idly in their cars and more time boosting their productivity in the workplace.\n\nRecent studies show that turning city centers into traffic-free zones also gives workers more time to patronize downtown businesses during their lunch hours and breaks.\n\nAnd city-center residents find such environments, free of blaring car horns and other nuisances, much more enjoyable.\n\nNo longer do pedestrians fear being hit by cars, a change of special importance to families who opt to raise children in downtown areas.\n\nFurthermore, workers and residents of central business districts who travel by bicycle experience a multitude of health benefits.\n\nAll in all, there is hardly any downside to imposing vehicle bans in what otherwise would be traffic-congested downtown areas.\n\nBut more support is in order. Mass transit desperately needs more financing.\n\nWashington, D.C.'s Metro system is the nation's most jarring example of that need. It has massive safety problems that cause daily delays and sometimes days of shutdowns for repairs. In addition, there are almost daily reports of its passengers being beaten and robbed by teenage gangs.\n\nWoefully underfinanced, the system, like many others, needs a major injection of tax dollars. Adding a new transit tax of 5 percent on people in big-city metro areas would go a long way toward curing this malaise.\n\nWith new revenue flowing in, following the examples of enlightened European cities would be possible.\n\nLast year, Oslo, the bustling capital of Norway, began banning some of the estimated 350,000 cars that jammed its central business district each day.\n\nAnd presto! There was a marked improvement in quality of life, worker productivity, and sales for downtown shops and restaurants.\n\nAs a result, Oslo plans to ban all cars from its city center by 2019. So far, the city's ban has received widespread public and political support.\n\nAlthough the car ban was the brainchild of the Norwegian Green Party, it quickly gained the support of the youth wing of the Conservative Party and is popular across the political spectrum.\n\nCopenhagen, the capital of Denmark, was the first city to experiment with a car ban. From a partial ban in 1962, Copenhagen quickly became a shining model for other cities.\n\nIts central thoroughfare, transformed from a traffic-clogged street to a pedestrian walkway with designated bike trails, is now one of the major tourist attractions in Europe.\n\nOther cities, mostly in Europe, are gradually aiming at the pedestrianization of their downtown hubs. These include Milan, Dublin, Paris, Madrid and Brussels.\n\nEven California, where a car was once considered an absolute necessity, has recognized the benefits of traffic-free downtown zones.\n\nSacramento's car-free historic area, which adjoins a similar pedestrian-only shopping and entertainment neighborhood, has been a major success story.\n\nThe momentum for change has obviously begun. Streetcars, which virtually disappeared in the late 1940s, are making a comeback in many cities.\n\nCar-free city centers are on the way! Their time has come.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Wayne Madsen is a progressive commentator whose articles have appeared in leading newspapers throughout the U.S. and Europe.

Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of Tribune or its editors.\nCON: Banning cars from urban centers creates more problems than it solves\n\"Take back our streets!\" is a common refrain among urban activists.\n\nNo, they're not talking about reducing violent crime, as many of them reside in affluent neighborhoods. What they want to take city streets back from is cars, which they see as a scourge that lowers their quality of life. But the alternatives they propose are much more costly and provide far fewer benefits.\n\nWhen mass transit use plummeted in the 1970s, anti-car activists succeeded in distorting government transportation funding to greatly advantage transit systems over highways.\n\nToday, even though more than 90 percent of households have cars, governments spend 28 percent of the nation's collective transportation funds on transit, with most of that money coming from state and federal fuel taxes as well as local property taxes.\n\nYet, despite this government gravy train, transit's market share is lower than it was in 1980, at less than 2 percent of trips made nationwide.\n\nEven when looking only at commuting trips, where trains and buses do best, transit accounts for less than 5 percent of the market share \u2014 one-fifth of its share of funding.\n\nThe myth that mass transit can serve most people does more than just waste taxpayer funds. Reducing access to cars contributes to unemployment and poverty.\n\nIn the New York City metropolitan area, where 40 percent of all U.S. transit trips occur and where one-third of the residents take transit to work, only 15 percent of jobs are accessible by transit in less than an hour.\n\nIn contrast, New Yorkers with cars can access more than five times as many jobs in 60 minutes. New Yorkers dependent on transit suffer from the longest commutes in America \u2014 even longer than New York drivers.\n\nClosing some streets to auto traffic can occasionally make sense.\n\nNew York's Times Square pedestrian plaza is often touted as a successful example. But most cities are not New York, and the nation's experiments with converting streets to pedestrian malls have mostly ended in failure.\n\nWhen cities such as Chicago, Philadelphia and Sacramento tried this in the 1960s and '70s in an attempt to revive their downtowns, customers stopped coming and businesses closed.\n\nBy the 2000s, nearly all these cities had reopened their streets to auto traffic. These cities attempted to create small car-free zones, not the car-free cities envisioned by activists. Following these activists' advice and closing off most urban streets to auto traffic would be a disaster.\n\nEnvironmental activists claim automobiles should be banned to curb air pollution, but that's not quite right. Yes, cars pollute, but they have become far cleaner over the last few decades and will be even cleaner still in the near future as cars achieve greater fuel efficiency.\n\nAnd environmentalists don't mention the polluting impact of traffic congestion. Instead, they often promote congestion and the resulting driver misery as a way to deter driving.\n\nThen there is the issue of traffic safety. The traffic congestion and low speeds in America's downtowns help keep serious car accidents rare relative to the rest of the country.\n\nThe majority of road fatalities occur in rural areas, where fewer than 20 percent of Americans live. The rest largely occur in the auto-oriented suburbs where most Americans reside, not urban cores. Attempting to seriously reduce auto injuries and fatalities by banning cars in the dense cities where crashes pose the lowest risk is both an overreaction and a misapprehension of the problem.\n\nNone of this means that there aren't problems with cars in our major cities, many arising from poor highway planning in the 1950s and '60s. Introducing congestion tolls and market-rate parking are the places to start.\n\nBut 21st-century problems will not be solved by trying to return our cities to the auto-free 19th century.

They think that cars make the area less enjoyable. But the other choices are not better.\n\nMost families in the United States have cars. Still, the government spends a lot of money on things like subways and trains. They should not get so much money if not many people use them. Subways and trains do not make very much money.\n\nThere is a myth that subways and trains are better than cars. However, it can be easier to get around in a car than in a subway. In New York City, many people take trains to work. However, these trains reach fewer places than cars can. New Yorkers who drive cars can get to many more jobs than New Yorkers who ride the subway can.\n\nWith Newer Cars, Air Is Cleaner\n\nSome cities tried to get rid of cars about 50 years ago. Customers stopped coming to shops and businesses closed.\n\nEnvironmentalists say we should get rid of cars to stop air pollution. That isn't quite right. Cars have become far cleaner in recent years. They will be even cleaner in the future.\n\nTraffic Safety Not A Big Problem\n\nThen there is the problem of traffic safety.\u00a0Most deadly car crashes happen in the countryside or in towns outside of cities. Car crashes do not often happen in city centers.\u00a0Getting rid of cars in cities is an overreaction. It is also a misunderstanding of the problem.\n\nThere are still problems with cars in our big cities. However, we cannot solve today's problems by returning to the\u00a0past.

This turn of events does not make Apple\u2019s refusal to help the FBI any less important.\n\nThe FBI backed off because it was able to obtain the information inside the phone without Apple's assistance.\u00a0However, the issues raised by this dispute have not been resolved. We can also expect similar disputes in the future. That\u2019s why it is important to understand why Apple was right to take the position it did.\n\nBasic American rights were at stake, and the purpose of law is to protect people\u2019s rights.\n\nConsider what the FBI asked Apple to do. The FBI did not ask Apple to turn over information it already had. This was nothing like a search warrant. Apple never had the information the FBI was seeking.\u00a0Instead, the FBI wanted Apple to write new software to unlock\u00a0Syed Farook's\u00a0iPhone.\u00a0\n\nFarook and his wife killed 14 people in a mass shooting in\u00a0San Bernardino last December.\u00a0The FBI thought\u00a0Farook's\u00a0phone might have important information about the\u00a0shooting. However, because of the privacy\u00a0features of the iPhone, the FBI could not search through\u00a0the phone without the password. The FBI asked Apple to create software to unlock the phone and allow their agents to search through it.\u00a0When Apple refused, the FBI\u00a0sought\u00a0to force the company to help by taking it to court.\u00a0\n\nFBI Demands Were Unconstitutional\n\nThe U.S. government has no right to force anybody to provide it services against their will.\n\nConsider the broader implications of the FBI\u2019s argument. FBI officials maintained that the U.S. government has the right to force companies to help it obtain people\u2019s personal information. Apple did not have any way to obtain the information on Farook's phone. The company\u00a0would have had to create new software to do what the FBI wanted.\n\nI have seen other arguments for supporting Apple. These arguments say Apple refused to unlock the phone for business reasons, to protect the value of its brand.\n\nShould the U.S. government\u00a0be able to force companies to damage the value of their own brand?\n\nApple phones have features that protect the privacy of people's information. The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution guarantees Americans this right to privacy. Individuals have the right to possess information without having to share it with the government. And Apple has the right to provide products that help individuals protect this right.\n\nReal Danger Is A Secret Attack On Rights Of All Americans\n\nYes, the Fourth Amendment also says the government has a right to search personal property. However, the government can only do this with a search warrant and a very good reason to do so. The Fourth Amendment\u00a0does not say that anyone else can be forced to aid the\u00a0government in its searches.\n\nIt does not matter whether the software the FBI wanted Apple to create would cause problems for phone owners. Forcing Apple to create such software would have violated the rights of the company.\n\nDuring World War I and World War II, Congress gave the president the power to force companies to aid the war effort. That power ended when the wars ended. The FBI wanted to claim similar powers over Apple during normal times. And it wanted to do so without Congress' approval.\n\nThis case was about more than the threat of a secret way to obtain the information in our phones. The real danger we face is a secret attack on\u00a0our rights.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Randall G.

This appears to let Apple off the hook legally.\n\nHowever, the FBI dropping its lawsuit against Apple does not mean\u00a0Tim Cook\u00a0acted justly. Cook is\u00a0Apple's chief executive officer, or CEO. Cook refused to unlock Farook's\u00a0phone without the password to help the FBI investigate the shootings. This refusal is hard to defend\u00a0when America and its allies are under attack from extremist groups.\n\nThe case against Apple might be over, but the issues behind it are unlikely to go away.

He labeled the request a \u201cbreach of privacy\u201d with \u201cchilling consequences\u201d for free speech. Cook might have been right. However, his actions\u00a0have set back the FBI's efforts to stop the actions of extremists by at least three months.\n\nThousands Of Extremists Could Be Plotting Attacks\n\nCook should also reconsider his use of the word \u201cchilling.\" It now seems out of proportion\u00a0after the recent Brussels, Belgium, and Pakistan bombings by the Islamic State extremist group.\u00a0The Islamic State\u00a0is also known as ISIS and ISIL.\n\nThe March 22 bombings in Brussels killed more than 30 people and put all of Europe on a red alert.

These groups of fighters are believed to be ready to\u00a0commit more\u00a0horrible\u00a0acts. They are only\u00a0waiting to receive orders from their superiors.\n\nU.S. intelligence experts have warned of a similar problem\u00a0for years. They worry that there may be several thousand extremists in America awaiting similar orders.\n\nOur political leaders have been slow to listen to those warnings. Now, hopefully, they will realize that what could be World War III has already started. It will not end until we stop the tens of thousands of\u00a0extremists\u00a0eager to carry out deadly attacks.\n\nCorporate America Made Important Sacrifices In World War II\n\nAs for Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, he might want to take a history lesson. He should consider how our nation\u2019s top CEOs responded to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s appeal for help after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.\n\nThe \u201cdastardly attack\u201d as FDR put it, severely damaged our Pacific naval fleet. FDR and his military leaders realized that our military was woefully outdated. Many of our planes, tanks and ships were left over from the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nTo correct this, FDR created the Committee for Economic Development. Paul G. Hoffman, the CEO of automaker Studebaker, led a committee with 20 of the nation\u2019s top corporate leaders.\n\nTheir mission: to make America \u201cthe arsenal of democracy.\u201d They accomplished that goal by\u00a0converting\u00a0the nation\u2019s largest industrial plants into factories for wartime production. A look at the top automakers of the time shows just what can be accomplished when companies help the government fight wars.\u00a0\n\nFord converted its large vehicle factory at Willow Run, Michigan, to produce aircraft. Some 24,000 B-24 Liberator bombers were made there.\n\nChrysler took over tank production, making more than 86,000 Sherman tanks.\n\nGeneral Motors, America\u2019s largest manufacturer, outdid everyone. The Detroit-based goliath produced 854,000 trucks, 198,000 diesel engines and 206,000 aircraft engines. GM also made 38,000 tanks, tank destroyers and armored vehicles.\u00a0\n\nHoffman\u2019s own Studebaker produced thousands of Weasels, a vehicle that could travel on land or in water. General Douglas MacArthur\u2019s troops used these vehicles to cross the jungles of the Pacific islands.\n\nAmerica\u2019s corporate leaders put patriotism ahead of profits. Many worked for $1 a year until the war ended.\n\nAs we enter what may be World War III, Apple\u2019s Cook might want to take particular note of their sacrifice. His salary last year, by the way, was $10.28 million.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Whitt Flora is an independent journalist and former chief congressional correspondent for Aviation & Space Technology Magazine.

The FBI is America's top law enforcement agency. It helps to keep the country safe. The FBI wanted Apple to help it get information from an iPhone. Apple is the company that makes iPhones. Apple said \"no.\"\n\nThe iPhone that caused this fight belonged to\u00a0Syed Farook.\u00a0Farook and his wife killed 14 people in California last\u00a0year.\u00a0The FBI thought Farook's phone might have important information on it. But the FBI did not have the phone's password.\n\nThe FBI wanted Apple to help them get into the phone without the password.\u00a0Apple would not help. The FBI had to find another way to get into the phone.\n\nApple did the right thing. It should not have helped the FBI. Instead, Apple helped protect an important American right.\u00a0\n\nFourth Amendment Protects The Right To Protect Privacy\n\nApple phones have passwords to protect people's information. The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says people have the right to protect their information. That is a very\u00a0important\u00a0right for all Americans.\u00a0\n\nApple has rights too. Apple has the right to make phones that help people protect their information.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment gives the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0government rights too. The government can search people's property and information, but only if done right. First the government\u00a0needs a very good reason for the search. Then it needs permission from the courts to do the search.\u00a0\n\nSometimes the\u00a0government\u00a0can have extra powers. Congress gave the president extra powers during World War I and World War II. The president was allowed to make companies help the United States fight the wars. Companies made things like tanks and guns. Those powers ended when the wars ended.\n\nThe FBI wanted that kind of extra power over Apple. That is a problem. This is not a war time. Congress never gave the FBI that kind of power.\u00a0\n\nApple's fight with the FBI was about more than one phone.\u00a0It was a fight to protect everyone's information.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Randall G.

This is good news for\u00a0America's main law enforcement agency. Farook and his wife killed 14 people\u00a0last year. The FBI might now learn more about the attack.\n\nApple is the company that makes iPhones.\u00a0The FBI asked Apple to help unlock, or open, Farook's iPhone without\u00a0the password. Apple said \"no.\" The FBI eventually found another way to open the phone.\u00a0\n\nTim Cook runs Apple. Cook made it harder for the FBI to learn more\u00a0about\u00a0Farook. He made it harder for the FBI to protect America. Cook made a bad choice. There are violent groups trying to attack America and its friends.\n\nCook had his reasons for saying \"no.\" He worried that helping the FBI would be bad for Apple's business. Cook worried that people would stop trusting Apple. He also worried that the U.S. government might try to take away some of people's rights.\n\nCook slowed down the FBI when he said \"no\" three months ago. Since then, some horrible things happened. The Islamic State set off bombs in Belgium and Pakistan.\u00a0The Islamic State is a violent group. It is also known as ISIS and ISIL.\n\nISIS might be planning more bomb attacks. These attacks might happen in the United States. Law enforcement agencies such as the FBI are very worried. The fight against groups like ISIS could even become World War III.\n\nApple CEO Should Study World War II\n\nApple\u2019s Tim Cook should study the history of World War II.\n\nAmerica entered World War II in 1941. American business leaders helped to win the war. Many businessmen ran car companies. These businessmen turned their car factories into war factories. They stopped making cars to sell. The companies made vehicles for the Army instead.\n\nAmerica\u2019s business leaders put the country first. Their own worries came second.\n\nTim Cook should think like the businessmen in World War II. He should help America win this war too.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Whitt Flora is a journalist.

We should expect a replay in the future; that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to understand why Apple was right to take the principled position it did.\n\nBasic American rights were at stake, and the purpose of law is to protect people\u2019s rights.\n\nConsider what the FBI asked Apple to do. The FBI did not ask Apple to turn over information it already had. This was nothing like a search warrant. Apple did not have the information the FBI was seeking \u2014 and never had it.\n\nInstead, the FBI wanted Apple to write new software to unlock the phone in order to help it search for the information. The government has no right to force anybody to involuntarily provide it services.\n\nConsider the broader implications of the FBI\u2019s argument. FBI officials maintained that the government has the right to force companies to undertake activities that will help the government obtain people\u2019s personal information. Apple was not hiding anything and would have had to create new software to do what the FBI wanted.\n\nThis is our government; but what if it was the Chinese government that wanted Apple to unlock the phones of Chinese citizens alleged to have broken the law? Would Americans \u2014 and the American FBI \u2014 support such attempts to force Apple to break into people\u2019s phones?\n\nIf the case had gone forward and the FBI had won, it would justify giving all governments the same powers the FBI wanted. When the time inevitably came, the U.S. government could hardly argue that a foreign government doesn\u2019t have the same right to force companies to aid their investigations. Would this really be in our long-term interest?\n\nI have seen the argument that Apple was refusing to unlock the phone for business reasons, to protect the value of its brand.\n\nLet\u2019s say this is true. Should the government be in a position to force companies to engage in activities that erode the value of their brand?\n\nApple phones have features that protect the privacy of information people have on them. The Fourth Amendment guarantees people this right to privacy. Individuals have the right to possess information without having to share it with the government. And Apple has the right to provide products that help individuals protect this right.\n\nYes, the Fourth Amendment also says the government has a right to search if it has a warrant and probable cause. But it does not say that third parties can be conscripted to aid the government in its searches.\n\nRegardless of whether the software the FBI wanted Apple to create would create problems for phone owners, forcing Apple to create such software would have violated the rights of the company and its stakeholders.\n\nWar powers in effect during the two World Wars gave the president substantial power to force corporations to redirect their resources toward producing output to aid the war effort. Those war powers were repealed after the wars ended. The FBI wanted to claim similar powers during normal times, without an act of Congress.\n\nMore than the threat of a backdoor into our phones, the real danger we would face is a backdoor attack on our rights.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Randall G.

The law exists to protect people\u2019s rights, not take them away.\n\nU.S. Government Can't Force Apple To Help\n\nThink about what the FBI asked Apple to do. The FBI did not ask Apple to turn over information it already had. Apple never had the information the FBI wanted.\u00a0Instead, the FBI wanted Apple to write a program to unlock, or open Farook's\u00a0iPhone.\u00a0\n\nThe U.S. government cannot do this.\u00a0The U.S. government\u00a0does not have the right to force anybody to help it against\u00a0their will.\n\nSome people think Apple was right to say \"no\" to the FBI for other reasons. These people say helping the FBI would have been bad for Apple's business. It would have made people lose trust in Apple.\n\nShould the U.S. government\u00a0be able to force companies to hurt their own business?\n\nApple phones have features that protect people's information. The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says people have the right to protect their\u00a0information.\u00a0Apple has rights too. Apple has the right to make phones that help people protect their information.\n\nWhen There Is No War, There Are No Extra Powers For The Government\n\nThe Fourth Amendment also gives the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0government rights. The government can search someone's property and information, but only if done right.\u00a0The government needs permission from the courts to do this.\u00a0The government\u00a0also needs a very good reason for their search.\u00a0\n\nThere have been times in history when the government has had extra powers. For example, Congress gave the president extra powers\u00a0during both World War I and World War II. During these wars, the president could force companies to build things to help fight the war. Those powers ended when the wars ended.\n\nThe FBI wanted that kind of power over Apple during normal times. The FBI wanted that kind of power without Congress saying it could have it.\n\nApple's fight with the FBI was about more than getting information from one phone. It was about our rights to protect our information.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Randall G. Holcombe studies social problems at the Independent Institute.

This is good news\u00a0for\u00a0America's national law enforcement organization. It might help the FBI learn why Farook and his wife killed 14 people in California\u00a0last December.\u00a0\n\nApple is the company that makes iPhones.\u00a0The FBI asked Apple to help them to unlock, or open, Farook's iPhone without the password. Apple said no. Then the FBI found another way to open the phone. Just because the FBI found a way to open the phone does not mean Apple was right to say \"no.\"\n\nTim Cook runs Apple. By saying \"no,\" Cook made it harder for the FBI to learn more about Farook. He made it harder for the FBI to protect America. That decision is\u00a0hard to defend when extremist groups are attacking\u00a0America and its friends.\n\nCook had his reasons for saying \"no.\" He worried that helping the FBI would break the trust between Apple and its customers. He also worried the U.S. government might take away some of people's rights.\n\nApple's resistance slowed FBI investigation\n\nCook might have been correct to worry about people's rights. However, he also slowed the FBI by three months. During these months some horrible things happened. The Islamic State\u00a0extremist group set off bombs in places such as Brussels, Belgium and Pakistan.\u00a0The Islamic State\u00a0is also known as ISIS and ISIL.\n\nThe March 22 bombings in Brussels killed more than 30 people. Brussels is the capital of Belgium, a country in Europe.\u00a0Brussels\u00a0is also the meeting place of the\u00a0European Union. The EU is a group of 28 European countries that work together to solve common problems.\n\nSecurity agencies in Europe are very worried. They believe small extremist\u00a0groups are hiding in Europe. These small groups of fighters might try to\u00a0explode more bombs.\n\nThe FBI and other government agencies are also worried. They worry there might be\u00a0small extremist\u00a0groups\u00a0planning attacks\u00a0in America too.\n\nHopefully,\u00a0America's leaders will start listening to these worries. Our leaders might even realize that World War III might have already started. It will not end until we stop the extremist groups waiting to attack us.\n\nApple Should Do What Businesses Did In World War II\n\nApple\u2019s Cook should take a history lesson. He should think about how American business leaders helped to fight World War II.\u00a0\n\nWhen the United States entered World War II in 1941, our planes, tanks and ships were very old. A group of 20 American businessmen\u00a0helped to change that.\u00a0Many of these businessmen\u00a0ran car companies.\u00a0\n\nThey turned their car factories into war factories. Their factories stopped making cars and started making vehicles for the Army.\n\nFord made 24,000 B-24\u00a0airplanes in a single factory.\n\nChrysler made more than 86,000 Sherman tanks.\u00a0\n\nGeneral Motors outdid everyone. GM produced 854,000 trucks, 198,000 diesel engines and 206,000 airplane engines. GM also made 38,000 tanks, tank destroyers and armored vehicles.\u00a0\n\nAmerica\u2019s business leaders put the country ahead of their own worries. Many worked for a dollar a year until the war ended.\n\nNow, the fight against extremists groups might become World War III. Apple\u2019s Tim Cook should think about the sacrifices made by businessmen in World War II. They only made $1 a year. Last year Apple's Cook made $10.28 million.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Whitt Flora is a journalist. He was a chief writer for Aviation & Space Technology Magazine.

How about the way a mother seabird spits out her own food to feed her babies?\n\nAll these animals have a few things in common. For one, they are families, and groups of them make up communities, just like groups of humans in a city do. They are a key part of what makes our earth so beautiful and special.\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, all three kinds of animals have another thing in common. They are all in danger of disappearing forever, of becoming extinct.\n\nUnique Needs\n\nAll three have very special needs. They need special living conditions to do well. Unfortunately, those living conditions are disappearing quickly.\n\nTake polar bears, for example. To live well, they need the ice caps and frozen temperatures found in Antarctica. Those conditions are fast vanishing from the planet. They are disappearing due to the steady rise in temperature known as global warming, or climate change.\u00a0\n\nWe humans are responsible for global warming, which is mostly caused by two things.\u00a0\n\nGases In The Atmosphere\n\nOne cause is the buildup of certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere is a thin sheet of gases that naturally surrounds our planet, and protects us. We have been adding gases that do not belong in the atmosphere.\u00a0Such gases are known as greenhouse gases.\u00a0\n\nGreenhouse gases are released when fuels like coal and gas are burned. We burn these fuels to power our cars and run our factories.\u00a0\n\nThe other main cause of global warming is that we are cutting down too many trees. The quick clearing of trees is known as deforestation.\n\nWe humans have a duty to protect our fellow animal friends. We must stop climate change before it is too late.\u00a0\n\nWhen we burn gas in our cars and coal in our trains, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released. It rises and ends up in the earth\u2019s atmosphere, where it traps heat from the sun. Today\u2019s levels of CO2 are almost twice as high as they have been over the last 800,000 years. As a result, temperatures around the world are rising quickly.\n\nDeforestation increases global warming, too, because trees naturally take in CO2. When a tree is removed, a little less CO2 is taken out of the air. More heat ends up being trapped in the atmosphere.\n\nAffecting The Animals\n\nWhat does all this have to do with our animal friends?\u00a0\n\nAnimals need to have certain average temperatures in the places where they live. Unfortunately, global warming is causing big shifts. Animals' surroundings are changing very quickly.\u00a0\n\nTake the polar bear we were talking about earlier. Many of the bears live on ice that is now melting away. Their homes are disappearing. Many of the animals they hunt are also disappearing, leaving the bears without enough food.\n\nFish are affected by global warming, too. For example, fish such as salmon and trout need water temperatures to be freezing. Now, rising water temperatures are causing them to die off.\n\nClimate change is leading to many other kinds of problems besides hotter weather.\u00a0\n\nMelting ice caps are causing ocean levels to rise. In turn, this is leading to flooding and disappearing shorelines.\u00a0\n\nAt the same time, hotter weather is drying out lakes and rivers. Many parts of the world are starting to run out of water. It may become increasingly difficult to grow the crops we all need to live.\u00a0\n\nThese are huge problems, and it can seem impossible for any one person to make a difference. Yet, there are many small things we can all do to help.\n\nFor example, we can be careful not to waste water. We can share cars, use buses more often, and ride our bikes or walk whenever possible.\u00a0\n\nIf we all pull together, we can save our planet, for us and for our animal friends.\n\nKevin Quinn is an American actor known for his starring role in the Disney Channel original series, \"Bunk'd.\"\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "550L": "Opinion: Saving our planet together\nBy Kevin Quinn, adapted by Newsela staff\n04.05.16\n\nA polar bear dries off after taking a swim in the Chukchi Sea in Alaska, June 15, 2014. Photo: Brian Battaile/U.S. Geological Survey via AP, File\nMany kinds of animals are in big trouble. They are in danger of dying out. They could soon be gone from our planet.\n\nMost animals have very particular needs. To live, they need things to be a certain way.\n\nTake polar bears, for example. They need the ice and freezing weather found in Antarctica.\n\nUnfortunately, the cold weather polar bears need is disappearing. It has been getting hotter all over the world.\u00a0\n\nGlobal Warming\n\nScientists call this change global warming.\u00a0\n\nMany polar bears live on ice that is now melting away. Their homes are disappearing.\u00a0\n\nMany of the animals polar bears hunt are also disappearing.\u00a0The bears no longer have enough food to eat.\n\nFish are being hurt by global warming, too.\u00a0For example, salmon and trout need freezing water to live. They are starting to die off as waters get warmer.\n\nPeople are responsible for global warming. It is up to us to do something about it.\n\nThere are two main reasons for global warming.\n\nOne is all the coal and gas we burn. We burn these fuels to run our cars and to power our machines.\n\nHarmful Gases\n\nWhen fuels are burned, harmful gases are released. Scientists call these greenhouse gases. CO2 is the main greenhouse gas.\n\nGreenhouse gases stay in the air after they are released. They trap heat from the sun. Over time, that makes the Earth hotter.\u00a0\n\nThere is a second main cause of global warming. People are cutting down too many trees. Scientists call this deforestation.\n\nTrees take in CO2. When there are fewer trees, there is more CO2 in the air. Then, it ends up getting hotter.\n\nBig Problems For Everyone\n\nGlobal warming is not just bad for animals. It is bad for people, too. In many places water is drying up. Soon, it will be hard to grow the food we need.\n\nThese are huge problems. It might seem impossible for one person to make a difference. Yet, there are many small things we can do to help.\n\nFor example, we can share cars. We can use buses more often. We can ride our bikes or walk whenever possible.\u00a0\n\nIf we do those things, a little less fuel will be burned. Then, a little less greenhouse gas will get released.\n\nIf we all pull together, we can save our planet. We should do it not just for us, though. We should do it for our animal friends, too.\n\nKevin Quinn is an American actor known for his starring role in the Disney Channel original series, \"Bunk'd.\"\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: When do we actually need to worry about climate change?\nBy Kevin Quinn\n04.05.16\n\nA polar bear dries off after taking a swim in the Chukchi Sea in Alaska, June 15, 2014.

Or the reason why an orangutan may spontaneously decide to groom its kin? How about the way a mother seabird regurgitates her own food to feed her babies while they grow in the nest?\n\nAll these animals have a few things in common. For one, they are families; comprising habitats and communities just like humans would in a city. They are beloved, sacred animals, and they serve as an integral part of the global diversity that makes our earth so beautiful and unique. Unfortunately, all three of these species have another thing in common \u2014 they are in danger of extinction.\n\nImagine losing your home to a raging fire. You\u2019ve lost everything. Your shelter, belongings, and even some of your family. What do you do? Where do you go? Will your quality of life ever be the same?\n\nUnfortunately for these animals, there is a harsh truth. The answer is no. Quality of life would never be the same again. The aforementioned species all have very specific habitat needs. Sadly, it is difficult to recreate the ice caps and freezing temperatures found in Antarctica that allow suitable living for the entire polar bear species. That is why we as humans, the most advanced and environmentally high maintenance species occupying the planet, have an obligation to both save and protect our fellow animal friends by stopping climate change before it is too late. For those of you who agree with me, there remains one question\u2026how? Well, let\u2019s start with what we know to be true.\n\nThere are two main factors that induce climate change. They are burning fossil fuels and deforestation. When we burn petroleum in our cars and coals in our trains, carbon dioxide, (CO2, otherwise known as a greenhouse gas), is both released and trapped by the earth\u2019s atmosphere, making for higher climatic temperatures around the world. Today\u2019s levels of CO2 are 40 percent higher than they have been over the past 800,000 years. Furthermore, deforestation of trees affects greenhouse gas levels as well, due to their natural output of oxygen and absorption of CO2. When a tree is taken up from the ground, there is less CO2 being absorbed, thus trapping more heat in the atmosphere. Although the list goes on, burning fossil fuels and deforestation are just two examples of human-induced global warming activities.\n\nNow you might be thinking, \u2018Great, but how does this apply to wildlife and different animal species?\u2019 Well, let\u2019s figure that out right now. Any species needs four essential habitat requirements in order to thrive. Let\u2019s start with the subject of temperature.\n\nAn animal needs the right temperature in his or her habitat to survive. Regrettably, global warming involves drastic temperature change. Take the polar bear we were talking about earlier, for instance. Melting arctic ice removes their hunting grounds, thus resulting in less food to be found, and even the destruction of their homes. Whereas temperature may affect animals living above ground, it also affects aquatic life forms living below it. For example, warmer water temperatures caused by global warming result in population decrease for cold-blooded fish like salmon and trout, which rely on freezing water to survive. Furthermore, warm ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching, a process that kills otherwise healthy coral, hence destroying many underwater ecosystems, since coral serves as the string that holds many of them together.\n\nClimate change also introduces many potential dangers in terms of water. When climate-induced flooding occurs due to high water levels, erosion increases. This in turn makes for polluted and degraded water quality. On the contrary, however, when we experience periods of too little water, (otherwise known as droughts), it kills the plants that animals consume to survive. This water cycle is vicious, and although temperature and water are two mere examples of global warming\u2019s effect on various species, there are other factors that we could discuss even further, if we wanted to. Depletion of food sources and places for animals to raise their offspring are among those important factors.\n\nThis all seems like important information, but it may seem as though it doesn\u2019t pertain to your personal life. It\u2019s normal to have that mentality, we call that skepticism. Skepticism is real, and it is a concept that basically says \u2018I, as a single human being, do not have enough power to change what is happening to the entire planet.\u2019 Yet when every person living on this earth has that same thought process, it becomes very difficult to make any progress. So rather than focus on the few big things we can do, let\u2019s focus on the many small things instead. Among these little things include turning off faucets, carpooling, using reduced-wattage light bulbs, and riding your bike or walking whenever possible. Of course, there are many more ways to get involved and reduce your carbon footprint, but just like any other large movement, small change is required first.

You have lost everything \u2014 your shelter, your belongings and even some of your family. What do you do? Where do you go? Will your quality of life ever be the same?\n\nWe humans would be able to restart our lives after suffering such a loss.\n\nUnfortunately for the animals mentioned above, the same is not true. The quality of their life would never be the same again if the places they lived in were destroyed. All have very particular needs, and require special living conditions that cannot easily be recreated.\u00a0\n\nTake polar bears, for example. To live suitably, they need the ice caps and frozen temperatures found in Antarctica. Sadly, it is difficult to recreate those conditions, which are fast vanishing from the planet. They are disappearing due to the steady rise in average temperatures known as global warming, or climate change.\u00a0\n\nWhat Causes Global Warming?\n\nWe humans are responsible for global warming. It is primarily caused by two things.\u00a0\n\nOne is the buildup in the atmosphere of heat-trapping gases, which are released when fuels like coal and gas are burned to power our cars and run our factories. Such gases are known as greenhouse gases.\u00a0The other main cause of global warming is the widespread cutting down of trees, known as deforestation.\n\nAs the most advanced species occupying the planet, we humans have a duty to both save and protect our fellow animal friends.

It ends up trapped by the earth\u2019s atmosphere, where it stores heat from the sun. Today\u2019s levels of CO2 are 40 percent higher than they have ever been over the past 800,000 years. As a result,\u00a0temperatures around the world have been rapidly rising.\u00a0\n\nDeforestation Causes Greenhouse Gas Levels To Go Up\n\nFurthermore, deforestation increases greenhouse gas levels as well, because trees naturally absorb CO2. When a tree is removed, there is less CO2 being absorbed and more heat ends up being trapped in the atmosphere.\n\nHow does all this apply to our animal friends?\u00a0\n\nAnimals need the place they live in to be a certain average temperature. Regrettably, global warming involves extreme temperature change, so animals' surroundings are changing quickly.\u00a0\n\nTake the polar bear we were talking about earlier. Melting arctic ice removes their hunting grounds, so there is now less food to be found. Even their homes are disappearing as glaciers that have existed for hundreds of thousands of years melt away.\u00a0\n\nIn addition to land animals, fish are also affected by global warming. Rising water temperatures are causing the death of fish like salmon and trout, which need freezing waters to live.\u00a0\n\nThese are just two examples of the damage caused by global warming; there are countless others.\n\nThe Effects Of Climate Change\n\nClimate change does not only affect the weather, it also affects water levels and the water supply. Melting ice caps are causing ocean levels to rise, which leads to flooding and disappearing shorelines. At the same time, hotter weather is drying out lakes and rivers in many parts of the world. Many places are starting to run out of water, making it more difficult to grow the crops we all need to live.\u00a0\n\nThese are huge problems, and it can seem impossible for any one person to make a difference. Yet, there are many small things we can all do to help.\n\nWe can be careful not to waste water. We can share cars, use buses more often and ride our bikes or walk whenever possible.

The rally was part of her Reach Higher initiative. Photo: Office of the first lady of the U.S.\nAs first lady, I have spent a lot of time talking with young people all across this country about education. I have heard about their hopes of going to college, getting good jobs and one day starting families of their own. I also have heard about the challenges they face: the rising costs of tuition and the insecurities and fears that come along with being first-generation college students.\n\nMy message to these young people is simple. While all of us adults \u2014 teachers, administrators and policymakers \u2014 have to do a better job of giving them the best schools and opportunities for their future, at the end of the day, they also need to step up and take responsibility for their education themselves.\n\nWhat that means is going to class every day, setting their goals high and working like crazy to achieve them. Education and hard work has been the story of my life and of my husband's life too. So when I talk to young people, my hope is that they see our story can be their story, too \u2014 as long as they are willing to dedicate themselves to their education.\n\nReach Higher For Higher Education\n\nI officially gave this effort to promote the value of education a name \u2014 my Reach Higher initiative. Its goal is to inspire young people to reach higher, by extending their education beyond high school so that they can own their futures. We are focusing on things like financial aid, college counseling, academic and summer planning, and college visits. Our goal is to ensure that every student in this country understands how to pursue and complete their education.\n\nWe are doing all of this because we know that these days, a high school diploma simply is not enough. To get a good job and be hired against applicants from all over the world, our young people need something more. The same thing is true for our country as well \u2014 we need a highly trained, highly educated workforce to compete in the 21st century. All across America, we need communities that truly value and promote education.\n\nThe truth is, it was not all that long ago that our country was setting the standard for the rest of the world. A generation ago, America had the highest percentage of college graduates in the world. Today, however, we have dropped all the way to 12th place. That is simply not acceptable, and that is why my husband set his \"North Star\" goal \u2014 that by the year 2020, we will once again have the highest college graduation rate in the world. Already, through efforts like Race to the Top, we are seeing states and school districts across the country make real improvements for our kids. Today, our high school graduation rate is the highest on record.\n\nWe've All Got Work To Do\n\nWhile we should be proud of these gains, we have still got plenty of work to do. It is going to take all of us to inspire our young people to reach higher. That means more parents encouraging their kids and demanding more from their kids' schools. It means creating more partnerships between high schools, colleges and businesses so that young people can learn the skills they will need for their future careers. It means cultivating a new generation of world-class teachers and school leaders. And, of course, it means young people stepping up to take responsibility for their futures as well.\n\nThe good news is we know that all of this is possible. Every day, we are seeing examples of communities stepping up to support their young people. I saw one of these efforts firsthand in San Antonio, Texas, where they were celebrating their fourth annual college week. I had a chance to speak at their college signing day, which is a huge rally with thousands of high school seniors who publicly announce their plans to attend and graduate from college.\n\nNot only the graduating seniors were involved \u2014 everyone in San Antonio wears their college T-shirts on signing day. All week long, the community holds college-application workshops for high schoolers and gives middle school students advice on getting to college.\u00a0\n\nFrom Immigrant To College Student\n\nEverything they are doing in San Antonio is helping to support the dreams of so many promising young people. They are young people like Rocio Alvarado, a remarkable young woman I met on my visit. Rocio's family came to the United States when she was a child, and they lived together in one tiny, crumbling room. Her father worked long hours for low wages, and when they needed money to pay for her mother's medications, Rocio helped sell homemade tamales outside her school. Despite these challenges, Rocio's family believed deeply in the power of education, and they pushed Rocio to study as hard as she could. So Rocio rose from English-as-a-second-language classes all the way to Advanced Placement classes. Next fall, she is heading off to the University of Texas at San Antonio to pursue her degree.\n\nThere are young people just like Rocio in every community in this country \u2014 young people with so much promise and so many skills. All they need is a little extra support from folks like us. So we have got to make the sacrifices and investments that will inspire every child to reach higher and give them an opportunity to fulfill their boundless potential. If we do that, then I am confident that we can give all our kids the bright futures they so richly deserve.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "680L": "Opinion: We must set high goals and work harder to improve education\nBy Michelle Obama, adapted by Newsela staff\n04.04.16\n\nFirst lady Michelle Obama speaks to nearly 2,000 high school students in May 2015 at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan.

They need to work hard and think big.\u00a0What that means is going to class every day. It means doing the best job they can on their homework.

The rally was part of her Reach Higher initiative. Photo: Office of the first lady of the U.S.\nAs first lady, I've spent a lot of time talking with young people all across the country about education. I've heard about their hopes of going to college, getting good jobs, and one day starting families of their own. And I've also heard about the challenges they're facing \u2014 the rising costs of tuition, their overstretched school counselors, and the insecurities and fears that come along with being first-generation college students.\n\nMy message to these young people is that while all of us adults \u2014 teachers, administrators and policymakers \u2014 have to do a better job of giving them the best schools and opportunities for their future, at the end of the day, they also need to step up and take responsibility for their education themselves.\n\nThat means going to class every day, setting their goals high and working like crazy to achieve them. That's been the story of my life and my husband's life, so when I talk to these young people, my hope is that they see that our story can be their story, too \u2014 as long as they're willing to dedicate themselves to their education.\n\nI officially gave this effort a name and an aspiration \u2014 my Reach Higher initiative. And that's really the goal: to inspire young people to reach higher to complete their education beyond high school so that they can own their futures. We're focusing on things like financial aid, college counseling, academic and summer planning, and college visits. Our objective is to ensure that every student in this country understands how to pursue and complete their education, whether it's at a traditional four-year college or a community college, or via a professional certificate or degree.\n\nWe're doing all of this because we know that these days, a high school diploma simply isn't enough. To get a good job and compete in the global economy, our young people need something more. And that's true for our country as well \u2014 we need a highly trained, highly educated workforce to compete in the 21st century. And all across America, we need communities that truly value and promote education for our children from Day One.\n\nI saw the power of cultural norms around education when I visited China. As I traveled the country, whether I was talking to kids or adults, whether I was in big cities or rural areas, I was struck by the strength and depth of people's commitment to education. I heard about parents making unbelievable sacrifices so their kids could attend school. I heard about students studying day and night in the hopes of getting a good job or being accepted into a university. I know that that's true in many other countries around the world as well.\n\nAnd the truth is, it wasn't all that long ago that our country was setting those kinds of standards for the rest of the world. A generation ago, America had the highest percentage of college graduates in the world. But today, we've dropped all the way to 12th in terms of young adults. That's simply not acceptable, and that's why my husband set his \"North Star\" goal \u2014 that by the year 2020, we will once again have the highest college graduation rate in the world. Already, through initiatives like Race to the Top, we're seeing states and school districts across the country make real improvements for our kids, and today, our high school graduation rate is the highest on record.\n\nBut while we should be proud of these gains, we've still got plenty of work to do to reach that North Star. It's going to take all of us to inspire our young people to reach higher. That means more parents pushing their kids and demanding more from their kids' schools. It means creating more partnerships between high schools, colleges, and businesses so that young people can learn the skills they'll need for their future careers. It means cultivating a new generation of world-class teachers and school leaders. And, of course, it means young people stepping up to take responsibility for their futures as well.\n\nThe good news is we know that all of this is possible. Every day, we're seeing examples of communities stepping up to support their young people in places from California to Iowa to New York. I saw one of these efforts firsthand in San Antonio, where they were celebrating their fourth annual college week. I had a chance to speak at their college signing day, which is a huge rally with thousands of high school seniors who publicly announce their plans to attend and graduate from college.\n\nBut it wasn't just the graduating seniors who were involved \u2014 everyone in San Antonio wears their college T-shirts on signing day. And all week long, the community holds college-application workshops for high schoolers and gives middle school students guidance and advice on getting to college. They even have prekindergarten kids create college-themed art projects, because it's never too early to start talking about higher education. Everything they're doing in San Antonio is helping to support the dreams of so many promising young people. They're young people like Rocio Alvarado, a remarkable young woman I met on my visit.

Photo: Irfan Khan/Los Angeles Times/MCT\nDiversity is hard to talk about. Many people in the U.S. have different ideas about diversity's good points. Others struggle to make diversity happen.\n\nSocial diversity is the difference in race and the other things that make you who you are. Studies show that social diversity can make people uncomfortable.\u00a0What is good about social diversity?\n\nGroups that come up with new ideas need diversity. Diversity helps people think in new and different ways. This means better problem solving.\u00a0\n\nDiversity Leads To Better Results\n\nDifferent people bring new ideas. They solve problems in different ways. A male and a female scientist might have different ideas, for example.\n\nStudies of large groups show that diversity leads to good results. One study found that companies with more women leaders did better. They made more money. Another study found the same thing with banks that had nonwhite leaders. They made more money too.\n\nThe studies on large groups have some problems. One is that they do not show why diversity works. We can make some good guesses by looking at diversity in small groups.\n\nDiversity Makes People Expect Different Ideas\n\nIn 2006, several scientists and I studied racial diversity in small groups. The people in our study needed to share what they knew. They were put in three-person groups. Some groups were all white. Other groups were made up of two whites and one nonwhite.\n\nThen, the groups were given a puzzle. Each person had things only he or she knew. The people in the group needed to share everything to finish the puzzle. The groups with one nonwhite person did much better than the all-white groups. Being with people like us makes us think we know the same things. This stopped the all-white groups from sharing all they knew.\u00a0\n\nOne study asked people to argue against someone else. Some were told the person had different ideas than them. Then, they tried harder. If they had to talk with someone with the same ideas, they were not as ready. When disagreement comes from a different person, we work harder.\u00a0\n\nDiversity is not only about adding new thoughts. It makes people expect different ideas. This changes how they act.\n\nMore Diversity Leads To Better Results\n\nPeople in a group of others like them think they will understand each other. When people see that they are different, they expect different feelings and ideas. They think they will need to work harder to work together. This leads to better results.\n\nImagine you are in a group. You think people might not agree. One person in your group is American. Another is Chinese. You all have to work together. Think about how your group should get along.\n\nDiversity works by promoting hard work and creativity. It also encourages thinking about alternatives. We need diversity if we want to change and grow.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "1110L": "Opinion: Diversity produces better results\nBy Scientific American, adapted by Newsela staff\n03.29.16\n\nLonguele Dieudonnee (left), from Congo, Solomon Kamara (center), from Liberia, and other students attend a rally held in Oakland International High School's cafeteria.

Photo: Irfan Khan/Los Angeles Times/MCT\nDiversity can be difficult to talk about, causing anxiety and conflict even in the U.S., where the conversation is more advanced. The Supreme Court cannot agree on diversity's strong points or how to accomplish it. Companies value diversity but still face lawsuits for being too white, and leadership in the business world is still mainly white and male.\u00a0\n\nWhat good does diversity do for us? The benefits of different expertise are obvious, but what about social diversity, the diversity of race, ethnicity and gender? Research has shown that social diversity in a group can make people uncomfortable and awkward. They lack trust and sense more interpersonal conflicts as well as many other problems. So what is the upside?\n\nThe fact is that if you want to build teams or organizations capable of innovating, you need diversity. Diversity enhances creativity and encourages the search for new information and points of view, leading to better decisions and problem-solving. Diversity can help companies earn more and lead to new discoveries and ideas. This conclusion comes from decades of research from leading experts such as psychologists, sociologists and many others.\n\nInformational Diversity Helps Organizations\n\nTo understand the positives of diversity, one must understand informational diversity, which is when people bring different points of view and knowledge to group problem solving. People who are different from one another bring unique information and experiences. A male and a female engineer might look at things as differently as an engineer and a physicist. That is a good thing.\n\nResearch on large, innovative organizations has shown that informational diversity is positive. For example, two business professors studied the effect of gender diversity, or having more women present, on the top management teams of companies. They found that companies with more women in top management meant an increase in value for the businesses and the companies' ability to come up with new ideas and methods.\n\nRacial diversity can deliver the same kinds of benefits. For example, several management professors looked at the heads of 177 U.S. banks in 2003. They found that for innovation-focused banks, increases in racial diversity in leadership meant better financial performance.\n\nOne problem with studies of large groups is that they only show that diversity happens alongside better performance, not that it causes better performance. Research on racial diversity in small groups, however, makes it possible to make some casual connections.\n\nDiverse Groups Share More Information\n\nIn 2006, several prominent professors and I decided to study the impact of racial diversity on small groups. In order to succeed, their subjects needed to be good at sharing information. They were put in three-person groups, some all-white, others with two whites and one nonwhite, and asked to\u00a0perform a murder mystery exercise. All group members had the same common information, but each member also had information that only he or she knew. To find out who committed the murder, the group members needed to share all their information. The groups with racial diversity did noticeably better than the groups with no racial diversity. This might be because being with similar people leads us to think we all hold the same information and ideas, which stopped the all-white groups from sharing information effectively.\u00a0\n\nThis effect is not limited to race. For example, last year a study was done where participants were asked what political party, Democrat or Republican, they belonged to. Then, they had to read a murder mystery and write an essay about who they thought committed the crime. Afterward, they all were told that they needed to convince a person that they disagreed with of their own point of view. Half were told to make their case to a member of the opposing political party. The other half were told to make a case to a member of their own party.\u00a0\n\nDemocrats were more prepared to talk to a Republican than a fellow Democrat, and Republicans showed the same pattern. When disagreement comes from a socially different person, we work harder.\u00a0\n\nDiversity Causes People To Work Harder\n\nDiversity is not only about bringing different ideas and feelings to the table. Simply adding social diversity to a group makes people believe that differences of point of view might exist among them, and that belief makes people change their behavior.\n\nMembers of a group of people who are the same think they will agree with one another, that they will understand one another's perspectives and point of view, and that they will be able to easily come to an agreement. But when members of a group notice they are socially different from one another, they change their expectations and anticipate differences of opinion and point of view. They assume they will need to work harder to find common ground. This logic helps to explain both the upside and the downside of social diversity. People work harder in diverse environments both socially and in how their brains function. They might not like it, but the hard work can lead to better outcomes.\n\nImagine you are writing a section of a paper for a presentation. You expect some disagreement and difficulty communicating because your collaborator is American and you are Chinese. Chances are, you will work harder on explaining your thinking and anticipating alternatives.\n\nDiversity works by promoting hard work and creativity and by encouraging the consideration of alternatives even before any interpersonal communication takes place. We need diversity, in teams, organizations and society as a whole,\u00a0if we are to change, grow and innovate.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: How diversity makes us smarter\nBy Katherine W. Phillips, Scientific American\n03.29.16\n\nLonguele Dieudonnee (left), from Congo, Solomon Kamara (center), from Liberia, and other students attend a rally held in Oakland International High School's cafeteria. The school, in Oakland, California, caters to newcomers from 33 different countries, including Afghanistan, Eritrea, Guatemala, Iraq, Somalia and Mongolia. Photo: Irfan Khan/Los Angeles Times/MCT\nThe first thing to acknowledge about diversity is that it can be difficult. In the U.S., where the dialogue of inclusion is relatively advanced, even the mention of the word \u201cdiversity\u201d can lead to anxiety and conflict. Supreme Court justices disagree on the virtues of diversity and the means for achieving it. Corporations spend billions of dollars to attract and manage diversity both internally and externally, yet they still face discrimination lawsuits, and the leadership ranks of the business world remain predominantly white and male.\n\nIt is reasonable to ask what good diversity does us. Diversity of expertise confers benefits that are obvious\u2014you would not think of building a new car without engineers, designers and quality-control experts\u2014but what about social diversity? What good comes from diversity of race, ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation? Research has shown that social diversity in a group can cause discomfort, rougher interactions, a lack of trust, greater perceived interpersonal conflict, lower communication, less cohesion, more concern about disrespect and other problems. So what is the upside?\n\nThe fact is that if you want to build teams or organizations capable of innovating, you need diversity. Diversity enhances creativity. It encourages the search for novel information and perspectives, leading to better decision making and problem solving. Diversity can improve the bottom line of companies and lead to unfettered discoveries and breakthrough innovations. Even simply being exposed to diversity can change the way you think. This is not just wishful thinking: it is the conclusion I draw from decades of research from organizational scientists, psychologists, sociologists, economists and demographers.\n\nInformation And Innovation\n\nThe key to understanding the positive influence of diversity is the concept of informational diversity. When people are brought together to solve problems in groups, they bring different information, opinions and perspectives. This makes obvious sense when we talk about diversity of disciplinary backgrounds\u2014think again of the interdisciplinary team building a car. The same logic applies to social diversity. People who are different from one another in race, gender and other dimensions bring unique information and experiences to bear on the task at hand. A male and a female engineer might have perspectives as different from one another as an engineer and a physicist\u2014and that is a good thing.\n\nResearch on large, innovative organizations has shown repeatedly that this is the case. For example, business professors Cristian Desz\u00f6 of the University of Maryland and David Ross of Columbia University studied the effect of gender diversity on the top firms in Standard & Poor's Composite 1500 list, a group designed to reflect the overall U.S. equity market. First, they examined the size and gender composition of firms' top management teams from 1992 through 2006. Then they looked at the financial performance of the firms. In their words, they found that, on average, \u201cfemale representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.\u201d They also measured the firms' \u201cinnovation intensity\u201d through the ratio of research and development expenses to assets. They found that companies that prioritized innovation saw greater financial gains when women were part of the top leadership ranks.\n\nRacial diversity can deliver the same kinds of benefits. In a study conducted in 2003, Orlando Richard, a professor of management at the University of Texas at Dallas, and his colleagues surveyed executives at 177 national banks in the U.S., then put together a database comparing financial performance, racial diversity and the emphasis the bank presidents put on innovation. For innovation-focused banks, increases in racial diversity were clearly related to enhanced financial performance.\n\nEvidence for the benefits of diversity can be found well beyond the United States. In August 2012, a team of researchers at the Credit Suisse Research Institute issued a report in which they examined 2,360 companies globally from 2005 to 2011, looking for a relationship between gender diversity on corporate management boards and financial performance. Sure enough, the researchers found that companies with one or more women on the board delivered higher average returns on equity, lower gearing (that is, net debt to equity) and better average growth.\n\nHow Diversity Provokes Thought\n\nLarge data-set studies have an obvious limitation: they only show that diversity is correlated with better performance, not that it causes better performance. Research on racial diversity in small groups, however, makes it possible to draw some causal conclusions. Again, the findings are clear: for groups that value innovation and new ideas, diversity helps.\n\nIn 2006, Margaret Neale of Stanford University, Gregory Northcraft of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and I set out to examine the impact of racial diversity on small decision-making groups in an experiment where sharing information was a requirement for success. Our subjects were undergraduate students taking business courses at the University of Illinois. We put together three-person groups\u2014some consisting of all white members, others with two whites and one nonwhite member\u2014and had them perform a murder mystery exercise. We made sure that all group members shared a common set of information, but we also gave each member important clues that only he or she knew. To find out who committed the murder, the group members would have to share all the information they collectively possessed during discussion. The groups with racial diversity significantly outperformed the groups with no racial diversity. Being with similar others leads us to think we all hold the same information and share the same perspective. This perspective, which stopped the all-white groups from effectively processing the information, is what hinders creativity and innovation.\n\nOther researchers have found similar results. In 2004, Anthony Lising Antonio, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Education, collaborated with five colleagues from the University of California, Los Angeles, and other institutions to examine the influence of racial and opinion composition in small group discussions. More than 350 students from three universities participated in the study. Group members were asked to discuss a prevailing social issue (either child labor practices or the death penalty) for 15 minutes. The researchers wrote dissenting opinions and had both black and white members deliver them to their groups. When a black person presented a dissenting perspective to a group of whites, the perspective was perceived as more novel and led to broader thinking and consideration of alternatives than when a white person introduced that same dissenting perspective. The lesson: when we hear dissent from someone who is different from us, it provokes more thought than when it comes from someone who looks like us.\n\nThis effect is not limited to race. For example, last year professors of management Denise Lewin Loyd of the University of Illinois, Cynthia Wang of Oklahoma State University, Robert B. Lount, Jr., of Ohio State University and I asked 186 people whether they identified as a Democrat or a Republican, then had them read a murder mystery and decide who they thought committed the crime. Next, we asked the subjects to prepare for a meeting with another group member by writing an essay communicating their perspective. More important, in all cases, we told the participants that their partner disagreed with their opinion but that they would need to come to an agreement with the other person. Everyone was told to prepare to convince their meeting partner to come around to their side; half of the subjects, however, were told to prepare to make their case to a member of the opposing political party, and half were told to make their case to a member of their own party.\n\nThe result: Democrats who were told that a fellow Democrat disagreed with them prepared less well for the discussion than Democrats who were told that a Republican disagreed with them. Republicans showed the same pattern. When disagreement comes from a socially different person, we are prompted to work harder. Diversity jolts us into cognitive action in ways that homogeneity simply does not.\n\nFor this reason, diversity appears to lead to higher-quality scientific research. This year Richard Freeman, an economics professor at Harvard University and director of the Science and Engineering Workforce Project at the National Bureau of Economic Research, along with Wei Huang, a Harvard economics Ph.D. candidate, examined the ethnic identity of the authors of 1.5 million scientific papers written between 1985 and 2008 using Thomson Reuters's Web of Science, a comprehensive database of published research. They found that papers written by diverse groups receive more citations and have higher impact factors than papers written by people from the same ethnic group. Moreover, they found that stronger papers were associated with a greater number of author addresses; geographical diversity, and a larger number of references, is a reflection of more intellectual diversity.\n\nThe Power Of Anticipation\n\nDiversity is not only about bringing different perspectives to the table. Simply adding social diversity to a group makes people believe that differences of perspective might exist among them and that belief makes people change their behavior.\n\nMembers of a homogeneous group rest somewhat assured that they will agree with one another; that they will understand one another's perspectives and beliefs; that they will be able to easily come to a consensus. But when members of a group notice that they are socially different from one another, they change their expectations. They anticipate differences of opinion and perspective. They assume they will need to work harder to come to a consensus. This logic helps to explain both the upside and the downside of social diversity: people work harder in diverse environments both cognitively and socially. They might not like it, but the hard work can lead to better outcomes.\n\nIn a 2006 study of jury decision making, social psychologist Samuel Sommers of Tufts University found that racially diverse groups exchanged a wider range of information during deliberation about a sexual assault case than all-white groups did. In collaboration with judges and jury administrators in a Michigan courtroom, Sommers conducted mock jury trials with a group of real selected jurors. Although the participants knew the mock jury was a court-sponsored experiment, they did not know that the true purpose of the research was to study the impact of racial diversity on jury decision making.\n\nSommers composed the six-person juries with either all white jurors or four white and two black jurors. As you might expect, the diverse juries were better at considering case facts, made fewer errors recalling relevant information and displayed a greater openness to discussing the role of race in the case. These improvements did not necessarily happen because the black jurors brought new information to the group\u2014they happened because white jurors changed their behavior in the presence of the black jurors. In the presence of diversity, they were more diligent and open-minded.\n\nGroup Exercise\n\nConsider the following scenario: You are writing up a section of a paper for presentation at an upcoming conference. You are anticipating some disagreement and potential difficulty communicating because your collaborator is American and you are Chinese. Because of one social distinction, you might focus on other differences between yourself and that person, such as her or his culture, upbringing and experiences\u2014differences that you would not expect from another Chinese collaborator. How do you prepare for the meeting? In all likelihood, you will work harder on explaining your rationale and anticipating alternatives than you would have otherwise.\n\nThis is how diversity works: by promoting hard work and creativity; by encouraging the consideration of alternatives even before any interpersonal interaction takes place. The pain associated with diversity can be thought of as the pain of exercise. You have to push yourself to grow your muscles. The pain, as the old saw goes, produces the gain. In just the same way, we need diversity\u2014in teams, organizations and society as a whole\u2014if we are to change, grow and innovate.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "710L": "Opinion: Diversity is hard, but it produces better results\nBy Scientific American, adapted by Newsela staff\n03.29.16\n\nLonguele Dieudonnee (left), from Congo, Solomon Kamara (center), from Liberia, and other students attend a rally held in Oakland International High School's cafeteria.

Companies want diversity, but their leaders are still mainly white men.\u00a0\n\nThe good things about having different skills are clear. What about social diversity, the diversity of race and the other things that make you who you are? Studies have shown that social diversity in a group can make people uncomfortable and awkward. So what is good about it?\n\nGroups that come up with new ideas need diversity. Diversity encourages creativity and curiosity. This leads to better problem solving. Diversity can also help companies earn and discover more.\u00a0We know this from many years of studies by experts.\n\nDiversity Leads To Information Diversity\n\nDiversity is good because of informational diversity. Informational diversity is when people bring other points of view to a problem. People who are not like each other have different knowledge and experiences. A man and a woman engineer might look at things as differently as an engineer and a doctor.\u00a0\n\nStudies on large groups show that diversity is good.\u00a0One study found that companies with more women leaders did better. They earned more money. Another study found the same thing with nonwhite leaders of banks.\u00a0\n\nThe studies on large groups have some problems. One is that they do not show why diversity works. We can make some good guesses by looking at diversity in small groups.\n\nWhen Groups Are Diverse, They Share More\n\nIn 2006, several scientists and I decided to study the effect of racial diversity on small groups. The people in our study needed to be good at sharing information. They were put in three-person groups. Some groups were all-white, and others were made up of two whites and one nonwhite. Then, they were given a mystery exercise. Each person had information that only he or she knew. The people in the group needed to share everything to finish the exercise. The groups with one nonwhite person did much better than the all-white groups. Being with people like us makes us think we all know the same things. This stopped the all-white groups from sharing information.\u00a0\n\nThis effect is not limited to race. One study asked participants to argue against someone else. If they knew the person had different ideas than them, they worked harder. Those who had to argue with someone with the same ideas were not as ready. When disagreement comes from a socially different person, we work harder.\u00a0\n\nDiversity is not only about different ideas. Simply adding diversity makes people expect different points of view. This changes how they act.\n\nWhen We're Different, We Work Harder To Agree\n\nPeople in a group of others like them think that they will understand each other's views. They think they will agree easily. When people notice they are different from one another, they expect differences of opinion and point of view. They think they will need to work harder in order to agree. This leads to better results.\n\nImagine you are writing part of a paper for a presentation. You expect some difficulties because your partner is American and you are Chinese. You will probably work harder to explain your thinking.\n\nDiversity works by promoting hard work and creativity. It also encourages thinking about alternatives. We need diversity if we are to change and grow.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "940L": "Opinion: Diversity makes us smarter\nBy Scientific American, adapted by Newsela staff\n03.29.16\n\nLonguele Dieudonnee (left), from Congo, Solomon Kamara (center), from Liberia, and other students attend a rally held in Oakland International High School's cafeteria.

Photo: Irfan Khan/Los Angeles Times/MCT\nJust the word \"diversity\" can cause anxiety and conflict.\u00a0Companies value diversity. At the same time, they still face lawsuits in court for not hiring enough nonwhites, and their leadership is still mainly white and male.\u00a0The Supreme Court cannot agree on diversity's strong points or how to accomplish it.\u00a0\n\nThe benefits of different expertise are obvious. What about social diversity, the diversity of race and other characteristics? Research has shown that social diversity in a group can make people uncomfortable and awkward. They lack trust and experience many other problems. So what is the benefit?\n\nIf you want to build teams or groups capable of new ideas and discoveries, you need diversity. Diversity enhances creativity and encourages curiosity, leading to better problem solving. Diversity can help companies earn more and lead to new discoveries and ideas.\u00a0This conclusion comes from many years of research from leading experts.\n\nInformation And Innovation\n\nInformational diversity is when people bring different points of view and information to group problem solving. People who are different from one another bring different knowledge and experiences. A male and a female engineer might look at things as differently as an engineer and a doctor.\u00a0\n\nResearch on large, innovative groups has shown that informational diversity is a good thing. For example, two business professors studied the effect of having more women leaders in top companies. They found that\u00a0companies\u00a0with more women did better and came up\u00a0with more new ideas. Another study found the same thing about having more nonwhite leaders at banks.\u00a0\n\nHow Diversity Promotes Better Thinking\n\nOne problem with studies on large groups is that they only show that diversity happens alongside better performance. They do not show that it causes better performance. We can make some casual connections by looking at diversity in small groups.\n\nIn 2006, several well-known professors and I decided to study the effect of racial diversity on small groups. Our groups were given a task. In order to succeed, our subjects needed to be good at sharing information. They were put in three-person groups, some all-white, others with two whites and one nonwhite. Then, they were asked to\u00a0perform a mystery exercise. All group members had the same common information, but each member also had information that only he or she knew. To find out who committed the crime, the group members needed to share everything. The groups with racial diversity did better than the groups with no racial diversity. Being with similar people leads us to think we all hold the same information and ideas, which stopped the all-white groups from sharing information effectively.\u00a0\n\nThis effect is not limited to race. For example, last year a study was done where participants were asked what political party they belonged to. Then, they had to read a mystery story and write an essay about who they thought committed the crime. Afterwards, they all were told that they needed to convince another person they disagreed with. Half were told to make their case to a member of the opposing political party. The other half were told to make a case to a member of their own party. Those who had to convince a member of their own party were not as prepared. When disagreement comes from a socially different person, we try harder.\u00a0\n\nThe Power Of Anticipation\n\nDiversity is not only about bringing different points of view to a problem. Simply adding social diversity makes people expect different points of view, which changes their behavior.\n\nMembers of a group of people who are the same think they will understand each other. They assume they will be able to easily come to an agreement. But when members of a group notice they are socially different from one another, they expect differences of opinion and point of view. They think they will need to work harder in order to agree. People in diverse environments work differently, both mentally and socially, leading to better results.\n\nImagine you are writing a section of a paper for a presentation. You expect some difficulties because one person you are writing with is American and you are Chinese. Chances are, you will work harder to explain your thinking and expect alternatives.\n\nDiversity works by promoting hard work and creativity and by encouraging the consideration of alternatives. We need diversity, in teams, organizations and society as a whole,\u00a0if we are to change and grow.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In"}, {"1130L": "Opinion: A competition \"winner\" may later become a cheater\nBy Scientific American, adapted by Newsela staff\n03.17.16\n\nA new study answers why some \"winners\" later become cheaters. Photo: Wikipedia\nMany aspects of our modern world are driven by competition. It powers our economy, sparks technological breakthroughs and encourages academic discovery. However, it also compels people to game the system and commit crimes. Some figure it is just easier \u2014 and even acceptable \u2014 to cheat.\n\nWhat if instead of looking at how people behave in a competitive setting, we tried to understand the consequences of competition on their everyday behavior? Business professor Amos Schurr and\u00a0psychologist\u00a0Ilana Ritov, both Israeli, attempted to do just that. In a study published this week they summarized their findings.\n\n\u201cHow can it be,\u201d Schurr asks, \u201cthat successful, distinguished people \u2014 take (former New York Governor) Eliot Spitzer, who I think was a true civil servant when he started out his career with good intentions \u2014 turn corrupt? At the same time, you have other successful people, like Mother Teresa, who don\u2019t become corrupt. What distinguishes between these two types of successful people?\u201d\n\nSuccess Measured Against Others\n\nSchurr and Ritov found that when people win a competition in which success is measured by social comparison rather than by a fixed standard, they are more likely to engage in unrelated unethical behavior. In the case of this study, they were more likely to try to cheat their peers out of money.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe are the first to ask what happens to contestants and their behavior after a competition ends,\u201d Schurr says. \u201cWe found that competitions have long-lasting effects.\u201d\n\nThe researchers performed a series of experiments to test these effects. For the initial competition, they had groups of students take part in an estimation task. The students were told that those who performed best at estimating the number of signs that flashed across a computer screen would be considered \u201cwinners\u201d \u2014 and would be given a pair of earbuds as a prize. In reality, however, winners were randomly picked.\n\n\"Winners\" Later Lie About Dice\n\nThe students were then assigned another task, with a different payoff. They were randomly split into pairs: One student was given two dice and a cup with a hole in the bottom, the other was told to simply watch. The pair then played a game over 12 shekels \u2014 Israeli currency worth about the same as 12 quarters. The first student was told to shake the dice and put the cup over the dice and shake it so that only he could see the results of the roll. His outcome, between 2 and 12, would dictate how many shekels he could take; his partner would receive the remaining amount.\u00a0\n\nNo one except Schurr and Ritov knew who had won or lost the initial competition. Students who had previously won the competition overclaimed the outcomes of their rolls and took in an average of 8.75 shekels, compared to the other students' average of 7.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou should note that they\u2019re not stealing from me, the researcher,\u201d Schurr says. \u201cThey\u2019re taking from their fellow students, from their friends.\u201d\n\nSchurr and Ritov repeated the dice-under-a-cup game after students participated in a number of other tasks in which \u201cwinning\u201d was defined in a different way. The researchers found that competitive settings determine behavior.\u00a0\n\nMeeting A Goal Is Different\n\n\u201cYou have two types of success,\u201d Schurr says. One involves \"social comparison,\" as with the estimation competition, and the other does not. \"And when you measure success in terms of \u2018how good am I\u2019 in reference to other people, that\u2019s when people may turn corrupt.\u201d\n\nFor instance, participants were asked to recall either an experience in which they won a competition or a situation in which they met a specified goal. The students who recalled winning a competition later cheated in the dice-under-a-cup game that followed, while the students who recalled meeting a goal did not.\n\nSimilarly, participants who had simply won a lottery did not end up cheating when they reported the outcome of the dice roll. However, participants who had outplayed their peers in a trivia competition did later overclaim their winnings.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhen we win in competition, in particular when we establish we are above others in rank, we will feel more powerful,\u201d says\u00a0psychologist\u00a0Dacher Keltner. \u201cAnd dozens of studies have found that the simple feeling of power makes people feel above the scrutiny of others.\" In turn, that can make them act in self-gratifying and unethical ways.\u00a0\n\nFeelings Of Power Involved\n\n\"Feelings of power,\" Keltner says, \"can indeed lead to various abuses like lying and stealing.\u201d This holds true, he adds,\u00a0whether the feeling of power comes from wealth, from a person\u2019s rank, or, as in this case, from winning a competition.\n\nSchurr and Ritov believe the cheating that occurred in their study was due to a number of possible psychological factors, particularly feelings of entitlement. Their study reinforces recent work that looks at the influence of social-economic privilege on moral behavior, says economist Shaul Shalvi.\n\n\u201cPeople who are of higher status would break the rules more often. So, for example, you\u2019re more likely to see a very fancy car ignoring the red traffic light compared to the guy in the normal car because they apparently feel entitled. So it\u2019s nice that this study links to that, because people of high status have probably had the experience of winning.\u201d\n\nSchurr and Ritov's\u00a0research suggests that discouraging social comparisons and focusing instead on fixed goals might be a good way to reduce cheating and other bad behaviors.

They wanted to see if winning changes people.\u00a0\n\nFirst, they had groups of students compete against each other. The students were told to say how many\u00a0signs were flashing across a computer screen. Those who were closest to the right answer won a prize.\u00a0\n\nThe winners were actually picked by chance. They had not really beaten other students, but they believed they had.\n\nThe students were then given something else to do.\u00a0\n\nGame Tested If Kids Were Honest\n\nFirst, they were split into pairs. One student in each pair was given two dice. Each of the two dice had six sides. Each side had a number of dots on it, from 1 to 6.\n\nThe student with the dice was supposed to roll them.\u00a0A roll of the dice gives\u00a0a number between 2 and 12.\u00a0\n\nThe other student was told just to watch.\u00a0Each had a chance to win part of some money.\u00a0\n\nOnly the student who rolled the dice could see how the roll turned out. It was up to him to tell the truth. The higher the number, the more money he would get. The other student got whatever was left over.\n\nSome Students Lied About Dice\n\nSomething interesting happened. The students who thought they won the first competition cheated. They said they got a higher number on the dice than they really did. The other students did not cheat.\n\nWhat is it about winning that makes people cheat?\n\nScientist Dacher Keltner thinks he knows the answer.\u00a0When we win a competition we start to feel better than other people, he says. We begin to think we have the right to do whatever we want. Suddenly cheating seems just fine.\n\nMaybe we should all think less about winning.

That is exactly what Amos Schurr, a business and management professor at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, and Ilana Ritov, a psychologist at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, discuss in a study in this week\u2019s Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \u201cHow can it be,\u201d Schurr asks, \u201cthat successful, distinguished people \u2014 take (former New York Gov.)

They were randomly split into pairs: one student was given two dice and a cup with a hole in the bottom; the other was told to simply watch. The pair then played a game over 12 shekels (the equivalent of 12 quarters), in which the first student put the cup over the dice and shook it so that only he could see the results of the roll. His outcome, between 2 and 12, would dictate how many shekels he could take; his partner would receive the remaining amount. No one except Schurr and Ritov knew who had won or lost the initial competition. Compared with a control group, in which the claimed payout was approximately 7, or the expected value (halfway between 2 and 12), students who had previously won the competition overclaimed the outcomes of their rolls and took in an average of 8.75 shekels. \u201cYou should note that they\u2019re not stealing from me, the researcher,\u201d Schurr says. \u201cThey\u2019re taking from their fellow students, from their friends.\u201d\n\nSchurr and Ritov repeated the dice-under-a-cup game after students participated in a number of other tasks in which \u201cwinning\u201d was defined by different parameters. The researchers found that competitive settings determine behavior. \u201cYou have two types of success,\u201d Schurr says. \u201cOne involves social comparison (as in the case of being a better estimator) and the other does not. And when you measure success in terms of \u2018how good am I\u2019 in reference to other people, that\u2019s when people may turn corrupt.\u201d\n\nFor instance, participants were asked to recall either an experience in which they won a competition or a situation in which they met a specified goal. The students who recalled winning a competition cheated in the subsequent dice-under-a-cup game, whereas the students who recalled meeting a goal did not.\n\nSimilarly, participants who had simply won a lottery did not end up cheating when they reported the outcome of the dice roll but participants who had outplayed their peers in a trivia competition (again, controlled for selection bias) did later overclaim their winnings. \u201cWhen we win in competition, in particular when we establish we are above others in rank, we will feel more powerful,\u201d says Dacher Keltner, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who did not take part in the research. \u201cAnd dozens of studies have found that the simple feeling of power makes people feel above the scrutiny of others and act in impulsive, self-gratifying and unethical ways. Feelings of power, whether it comes from wealth, a person\u2019s position in a hierarchical structure or in this case competition, can indeed lead to various abuses like lying and stealing.\u201d\n\nSchurr and Ritov attribute the cheating that occurred in their study to a number of possible psychological mechanisms, particularly entitlement. Their study \u201cties into recent work that relates to the influence of social-economic status and its influence on ethical behavior,\u201d says Shaul Shalvi, a behavioral economist at the University of Amsterdam who was not part of this study. \u201cPeople who are of higher status would break the rules more often. So, for example, you\u2019re more likely to see a very fancy car ignoring the red traffic light compared to the guy in the normal car because they apparently feel entitled. So it\u2019s nice that this study links to that, because people of high status have probably had the experience of winning.\u201d\n\nSchurr plans to continue his line of research. \u201cWe could look at the other side of the coin and see how much competition winners contribute to society as a whole,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead of doing bad things, will people do good things after the competition ends?\u201d He also mentioned the possibility of better understanding gender differences in winner behavior. And it would no doubt be valuable to analyze real-world competitions. \u201cThere\u2019s always a trade-off between experimental control, which was high in this study, and the ability to generalize the findings,\u201d Shalvi says. \u201cSo these experiments are very important and telling in clarifying underlying psychological mechanisms of the dark or dangerous consequences of competition. But what still remains to be seen is whether these effects cannot also be seen when analyzing data from sport competitions and business-related competitions.\u201d\n\nIf confirmed by such analyses, the research suggests that discouraging social comparisons and focusing instead on fixed goals might be a good way for organizations \u2014 from sport teams to businesses to governments \u2014 to reduce corruption.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "950L": "Opinion: After they compete, \"winners\" are likely to cheat\nBy Scientific American, adapted by Newsela staff\n03.17.16\n\nA new study answers why some \"winners\" later become cheaters.

Until now, though, no one thought to look at things from another angle: Could winning make people behave badly in other areas of their life?\u00a0\n\nBusiness professor Amos Schurr and\u00a0psychologist\u00a0Ilana Ritov decided to try to answer just that question. In a study published this week, the two Israeli researchers summarized their findings.\n\nWhy Do Honest People Start Cheating?\n\nWhy is it, Schurr asks, that some \"successful, distinguished people\" who start out honest and well-intentioned end up lying, cheating and stealing, while others do not? What distinguishes between these two types of successful people? Could it have something to do with the nature of their success?\n\nSchurr and Ritov say there are two kinds of success: One involves beating others in some form of competition, while the other is measured by a fixed standard. Based on their research, they believe those who achieve success by beating others are more likely to behave badly in other areas of their life. In the case of their study, those who won in competition were more likely to try to cheat others out of money.\u00a0\n\nThe researchers performed a series of experiments to test what effect winning a competition can have. First, they had groups of students take part in an estimation task. The students were told that those who performed best at estimating the number of signs that flashed across a computer screen would be considered \u201cwinners.\u201d The winners would then be given a pair of earbuds as a prize.\u00a0\n\nStudy's \"Winners\" Chosen By Chance\n\nThe competition's \"winners\" were actually picked by chance. They had not actually beaten other students, but they believed they had.\n\nThe students were then given another task. First, they were split into pairs. One student was given two dice and a cup with a hole in the bottom. The other was told to simply watch. The pair then played a game over a small amount of money: 12 shekels, Israeli money roughly the same as 12 quarters.\u00a0\n\nThe first student was told to shake the dice and keep the cup over them so that only he could see the results of the roll. His outcome, between 2 and 12, would determine how many shekels he could take. His partner would receive the remaining amount.\u00a0\n\nStudents who believed they had won the estimation competition overclaimed the outcomes of their rolls. They took in an average of 8.75 shekels, compared to the other students' average of 7.\u00a0\n\nSocial Contests Vs. Fixed Goals\n\nSchurr and Ritov repeated the dice-under-a-cup game after students participated in a number of other tasks in which \u201cwinning\u201d was defined in a different way. The researchers found that competitive settings determine behavior.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou have two types of success,\u201d Schurr says. One involves \"social comparison,\" in which success is measured by how well you do in comparison to others. The other is simply a matter of achieving a certain goal. Schurr says the first kind of success encourages cheating, while the second does not.\n\n\u201cWhen we win in competition, in particular when we establish we are above others in rank, we will feel more powerful,\u201d says\u00a0psychologist\u00a0Dacher Keltner. Dozens of studies have found that the feeling of power can make people think they have the right to behave however they want.\n\n\"Feelings of power,\" Keltner says, \"can indeed lead to various abuses like lying and stealing.\u201d This holds true, he adds,\u00a0wherever the feeling of power come from. It can come from wealth, from a person\u2019s rank or from winning a competition.\n\nSchurr and Ritov's\u00a0research suggests a possible solution. A\u00a0good way to reduce cheating and other bad behaviors might be to\u00a0discourage social comparisons and focusing instead on fixed goals. Taking that approach might help cut down on bad behavior in a range of settings \u2014 from sport teams to businesses to governments.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "650L": "Opinion: Why do some \"winners\" later become cheaters?\nBy Scientific American, adapted by Newsela staff\n03.17.16\n\nA new study answers why some \"winners\" later become cheaters. Photo: Wikipedia\nPeople compete against each other in many ways. They play against each other in sports. They try to get the top grade in school. They try to outshine others at work.\u00a0\n\nCompetition can drive people to do great things. However, it also makes people behave badly. Some figure the easiest way to win is to cheat. They act unfairly or lie.\n\nWhat about winning itself, though? Does winning make people behave differently? Could it make them more likely to cheat later on?\u00a0\n\nAmos Schurr and Ilana Ritov decided to try to answer those questions. Schurr is a business professor, and Ritov is a scientist who studies the human mind. Both live in Israel.\u00a0\n\nThe two released a report of their findings earlier this week.\n\nSome People Stop Being Honest\n\nSchurr has always wondered about people with a lot of success. Some start out honest and wanting to do good things, but end up lying, cheating and stealing. Others stay honest.\u00a0\n\nWhat makes these two types of successful people turn out differently? Could it have something to do with the nature of their success?\n\nSchurr and Ritov say there are two kinds of success. People can succeed by beating others in some form of competition. Or, they can succeed by doing a good job at something.\u00a0\n\nSchurr and Ritov say their study shows\u00a0that the first kind of success changes people. When people beat others in a competition they start to think differently. They become more likely to behave badly.\u00a0\n\nExperiments Test What People Will Do\n\nSchurr and Ritov performed several\u00a0experiments to find out what happens when people win competitions. They wanted to see if winning changes people.\u00a0\n\nFirst, they had groups of students compete against each other. The students were told to say how many\u00a0signs were flashing across a computer screen. Those who were closest would be declared the winners. They would be given\u00a0a prize.\u00a0\n\nThe winners were actually picked by chance. They had not really beaten other students, but they believed they had.\n\nThe students were then given something else to do. First, they were split into pairs. One student was given two dice and a cup with a hole in the bottom. The other was told just to watch.\u00a0\n\nThe pair then played a game. Each had a chance to win a certain amount of money. The money could be up to 12 Israeli shekels, roughly the same as 12 quarters.\u00a0\n\n\"Winners\" Later Cheat In Dice Game\n\nThe first student was told to shake the dice and keep the cup over the them so that only he could see the results of the roll. His outcome would be between 2 and 12. It would decide how many shekels he could take. The other student would receive the remaining amount.\u00a0\n\nThe students who believed they had won the first competition cheated. They said they had rolled a higher number than they actually had. They ended up taking more money than they deserved. The students who had not won the earlier competition did not cheat.\n\nWhat is it about winning that makes people behave badly?\n\nWhen we win a competition, it makes us feel better than other people, says scientist Dacher Keltner. It makes us feel like we have more power than others. We begin to think we have the right to behave however we want. Cheating starts to seem just fine.\n\nSchurr and Ritov's study may have a lesson for us all. Perhaps success should not be based on beating other people. Instead, it should be based on doing something well.\u00a0\n\nThere might be less lying and cheating if more people thought that way.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In"}, {"970L": "PRO/CON: Self-driving cars are just around the corner.

Yes, and they have been for more than a century.\n\nThe horses that pulled buggies did not need anyone to drive them. They were\u00a0capable of finding their way home with little or no help from humans. Traveling without a driver is not a new idea \u2014 it\u2019s just a better way to travel.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the number of vehicles increased. The rate of deaths and injuries caused by vehicular accidents likewise jumped. Modern technology and safer car design have helped decrease the number of fatal crashes, but the numbers still remain staggering.\n\nMaking The Streets Safer\n\nIn the U.S. alone, vehicular accidents have killed more than 32,000 people each year for the past five years in which accidents were tracked. That\u2019s as if five 737 jets crashed every week. It is more than double the number of people who died worldwide during the recent Ebola outbreak.\n\nBetween 93 percent and 95 percent of these\u00a0fatal accidents are caused by human error. That figure comes from the\u00a0National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the government agency that works to make America's roads safe.\u00a0\n\nIn addition to deaths, vehicle accidents send about 2.5 million injured people per year to emergency rooms.\u00a0We accept these accidents because cars are incredibly useful and give us the freedom to go where we want, when we want. Self-driving vehicles deliver even greater utility by freeing driving time for other things. Instead of driving, people could be texting, working or just relaxing.\n\nThe self-driving cars that are now being developed use many forms of technology to drive themselves. Radar, cameras and other devices are used to \"see\" the world around the car. Advanced computer systems drive the car from one destination to another without any help from humans. These cars should soon be ready for mass production.\n\nSelf-driving cars remove many of the human mistakes that cause injuries and deaths.\u00a0Self-driving cars can also help disabled and elderly people get from place to place on their own.\n\nOn The Road Toward Self-Driving\n\nThat is not all. Young people seem to love driving less than they did in the past.\u00a0They drive fewer miles and some do not even get their driver's\u00a0license. Rather than driving to see friends, they may\u00a0simply text or call them. For many young people, owning a smartphone is now more important than owning a car.\n\nBuying a car is also a major expense, as is paying for the gas that fuels it. Then there is the insurance people have to buy to protect them in case they get into an accident. A good insurance plan might pay for all the damage caused by an accident, but it could also cost hundreds of dollars each month. That cost would be lower with self-driving cars.\u00a0\n\nIn some ways self-driving cars are already here. Some of the most recent safety improvements in cars come very close to self-driving. New technology can control a car's speed, keep it in its lane and help with parking. These put us on\u00a0a clear path toward self-driving cars.\n\nOf course, self-driving cars will not create a perfect world. There will still be some accidents, although far fewer. There will be some people who will never give up driving their cars and others who live in areas difficult to serve with self-driving cars.\n\nSome lawmakers may try to prevent self-driving cars from using our roads. They might do this fearing the criticism that will come after the first accident caused by a\u00a0self-driving car. Other people will see self-driving cars as a threat to their business and try to stop them from\u00a0becoming\u00a0popular.\n\nSelf-driving cars offer such a wealth of advantages that it makes little difference whether Americans are ready. Americans need to get ready. Self-driving cars will soon be in their rear-view mirrors.\u00a0\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Robert W.

They question every decision a driver makes and sometimes they can be nagging. They constantly attempt to correct what they consider to be the driver's errors of judgment.\n\nCan you imagine a backseat computer doing the same thing? One you can\u2019t kick to the curb?\n\nThe computer in question would actually be under the dashboard. It will soon be taking over the driving for you.\n\nIt\u2019s the self-driving car, and it\u2019s no longer science fiction. It\u2019s already here. Bits and pieces of it, anyhow. Many new cars use cameras and sensors to park themselves, for instance. Others have accident avoidance systems that can completely stop the car without the driver even touching the brakes.\n\nIntroducing The V2V Cadillac\n\nNext year, General Motors will debut vehicle-to-vehicle, or V2V, communications in some of its\u00a0Cadillac\u00a0models.\n\nThe system makes it possible for cars with V2V technology to have electronic conversations among themselves. They will be aware of one another\u2019s position and speed in order to predict and avoid accidents. This could prevent situations where, for instance, car A runs a red light because its driver wasn\u2019t paying attention and strikes car B.\n\nWith V2V, the driver of car A would be safety-netted by the car. Car A would automatically brake for the light and avoid hitting car B.\n\nThese are some of the elements of the fully self-driving car. And some of it sounds good \u2014 and may well be. But taking the driver out of the equation entirely \u2014 or relying too much on technology \u2014 can have its downside, too.\n\nAs anyone who owns a computer knows, computers develop glitches. It\u2019s annoying when it happens at your desk. But it could be deadly when it happens at 75 miles per hour on the freeway.\n\nAnd it\u2019s probably more likely to happen with a self-driving car. The computer that controls the car \u2014 unlike the computer on your desk \u2014 will be subjected to extremes of heat and cold, vibration and moisture, et cetera.\n\nOver time, something\u2019s likely to go wrong. If the human driver has become only a passenger \u2014 no longer expected or perhaps even able to actually drive the car \u2014 what will happen?\n\nIf The Driver's No Longer The Driver ...\n\nAnd who will be responsible? Legally speaking, the driver is currently responsible for the safe operation of the vehicle.\n\nBut how can we hold the driver responsible when he or she is no longer the driver?\n\nWill the manufacturer of the self-driving car be to blame in that case?\n\nHow will car insurance rules and costs change?\n\nIf the driver no longer is a driver, why should he or she be required to buy insurance at all? If the person is not actually driving the car, he or she will not need protection from the damages caused by any accidents. Will he or she even need a driver's license? When you ride the bus you are not required to have a special\u00a0license\u00a0\u2014 or carry\u00a0insurance. Why wouldn\u2019t the same\u00a0principle\u00a0apply here?\n\nAn even bigger problem with self-driving cars is how to program them to ignore traffic laws when it\u2019s necessary in order to avoid an accident. For example, cars cannot cross the double yellow line. What happens if a child runs into the car\u2019s path and the only way to avoid hitting the child is to turn out of the way?\n\nIt\u2019s against the law, technically, to cross the double yellow line \u2014 but it\u2019s the right thing to do in this instance. And a human driver would do it, but a self-driving car might not because it is programmed to obey the traffic laws. Unlike humans, the self-driving car cannot use its judgment to ignore a law to save a life.\n\nAlso, how will self-driving cars deal with human-driven cars, and what about the reverse? Will\u00a0people who own human-controlled cars be required to turn their cars in or no longer be allowed to drive them?\n\nTechnology is usually a good thing, but problems arise when technology is no longer under human control, as could happen here.\n\nTechnology that assists human drivers \u2014 that\u2019s a great idea. But technology that pre-empts them \u2014 that could be a very bad idea, indeed.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Eric Peters is a veteran automotive journalist and author of \u201cRoad Hogs\u201d and \u201cAutomotive Atrocities.\u201d Readers may write him at 721 Hummingbird Lane SE, Copper Hill, VA 24079 and visit his web site at www.EPautos.com.\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers.

We have been ready for more than 100 years.\u00a0\n\nBefore we had cars, we had horses that pulled buggies. The horses did not need anyone to drive them. They found their way home with almost no help from humans. Traveling without a driver is not new.\n\nCars first appeared in the early 1900s. As more people began driving, the\u00a0amount of car accidents went up. Technology has helped lower the number of people killed in car\u00a0accidents. The number is still too high.\u00a0\n\nOne study looked at car accidents in the United States. It showed that more than 30,000 people died in car accidents each year.\u00a0\n\nWe live with these accidents because cars are useful. Cars allow people to drive anywhere they want.\u00a0Self-driving\u00a0cars are even more useful. Self-driving\u00a0cars\u00a0allow people\u00a0to do other things. People can use their phones, work or just relax. The car drives itself.\u00a0\n\nNo More Human Mistakes While Driving\n\nSelf-driving cars use many forms of technology to drive themselves. Cameras and other sensors help the car \"see\" the world around it. Computers drive the car from one place to another. People do not drive at all. These cars will soon be ready for everyday use.\n\nSelf-driving cars are safer than regular cars.

Drivers especially do not like it when other people tell them how to drive.\u00a0\n\nSoon computers will tell people how to drive. Even worse, some cars will do all the driving themselves.\u00a0\n\nThe self-driving car is not a dream. It is here. Bits and pieces of it, at least. Many new cars use cameras and sensors to park themselves. Others have computers that can stop the car without the driver even touching the brakes. These computers try to stop accidents before they happen.\n\nCars \"Talking\" To Each Other\n\nNext year, General Motors will put even stronger computers in some cars. These cars will have\u00a0vehicle-to-vehicle technology, or V2V for short.\n\nV2V technology\u00a0allows cars to \"talk\" to each other. The cars use electronic signals to talk just like people use phones to talk to other people. The cars tell each other where they are. The cars also say how fast they are going.\u00a0They will use V2V technology to stop accidents from happening.\n\nV2V could stop common accidents such as when\u00a0a driver stops paying attention to the road. This driver might drive through a red light. Driving through a red light is one way accidents happen.\n\nWith V2V, the driver would be saved by the car. The car would stop itself at the red light. The accident would never happen.\n\nTechnology like V2V in a car is good. It can save lives. However, taking all control away from drivers can be bad. A driver should always have some control of the car.\u00a0\n\nStill Need A Person Behind The Wheel\n\nIt is very easy for computers to have problems. If the computer in a self-driving car has a problem, that could be very bad. The car could go out of control. It could cause an accident. That is one reason why drivers should always have some control of their car.\u00a0\n\nAnother reason is traffic laws. Traffic laws can be complicated. Sometimes drivers need to break a law in order to stop an accident.\n\nFor example, cars cannot cross two yellow lines. It is against the law to do so. If a child runs into the path of a car, the car cannot always stop. The only way to avoid the child might be to drive over the two lines. A person would do that. A self-driving car might not. The car might not be able to break that law in order to\u00a0stop an accident.\n\nTechnology is usually a good thing.\u00a0Technology that helps drivers is a great idea.\n\nProblems can happen when\u00a0technology is not under control.

The NHTSA estimates the U.S. economic and social costs of vehicle accidents, excluding the cost of car ownership, at $871 billion a year.\n\nTake a simple test. In your local newspaper, carefully read each account of a person killed or injured by vehicles. Then ask, would this tragedy have been avoided, or the injury mitigated, if one or more of the vehicles had been self-driving?\n\nWe tolerate this carnage because cars bring great utility and freedom. Self-driving vehicles deliver even greater utility by freeing driving time for other things \u2014 be it texting, working or just relaxing.\n\nSelf-driving cars also deliver huge benefits to the disabled and the elderly who would otherwise lose their licenses. At the same time, self-driving cars remove much of the human error that contributes to the vast majority of injuries and deaths.\n\nSelf-driving cars also deliver a number of broader social utilities. These range from far more efficient use of our present land and infrastructure to more overall productive lives.\n\nAmericans have dreamed of driverless, horseless carriages since the \u201930s, but their advent had to await the development of cheap and convenient computing power. Let\u2019s look at a few interesting facts.\n\nYoung people today seem far less enamored with driving than in the recent past. If they license at all, many license much later and drive fewer miles. Rather than driving to see friends, they may opt to text or call. Smartphones rather than cars may be today\u2019s status symbol.\n\nIn addition, car ownership is a major expense. Using fleets of on-call vehicles saves not only the cost of a depreciating asset that spends 95 percent of its time idle, but also saves on the other major cost of a car: insurance.\n\nWhen polled about self-driving cars, potential customers cite higher safety and lower insurance costs as the two most persuasive factors.\n\nIndeed, in many respects, self-driving cars are already here. You may be followed by one. Some of the most recent safety improvements will virtually drive the car. Adaptive cruise control, lane keeping, traffic jam and parking assist are just the most recent developments in a clear trajectory toward self-driving cars.\n\nOf course, self-driving cars will not create utopia. There will still be some accidents, although far fewer. There will be some people who will never give up their cars. There will be some who live in areas difficult to serve with self-driving cars.\n\nSome regulators may stall because they fear criticism after the first unfortunate fatality. And there will be some who will argue self-driving cars are unsafe because they see them as a threat to their business. One can hardly expect emergency rooms and funeral parlors to argue they need more business.\n\nSelf-driving cars offer such a wealth of advantages that it makes little difference whether Americans are ready.

Legally speaking, the driver is currently responsible for the safe operation of his vehicle.\n\nBut how can we hold him responsible when he\u2019s no longer the driver?\n\nWill the manufacturer of the self-driving car be liable in that case?\n\nHow will car insurance requirements and costs change?\n\nIf the driver no longer is a driver, why should he be required to buy insurance at all? Or have a license, for that matter? When you ride the bus you are not required to have a special permit \u2014 or carry coverage. Why wouldn\u2019t the same principle apply here?\n\nAn even bigger problem with autonomous cars is how to program them to disregard traffic laws when it\u2019s necessary to do so in order to avoid an accident.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s illegal to cross the double yellow line \u2014 but what if a child runs into the car\u2019s path and the only way to avoid hitting her is to swerve out of the way?\n\nIt\u2019s illegal, technically, to cross the double yellow \u2014 but it\u2019s the right thing to do. And a human driver would do it. An autonomous car wouldn\u2019t. Because it is programmed to obey the law. Unlike humans, it cannot use judgment; does not do nuance.\n\nAlso, how will autonomous cars deal with cars not autonomous, and what about the reverse? Will people who own human-controlled cars be required to turn their cars in or no longer be allowed to drive them?\n\nTechnology is usually a good thing, but problems arise when technology is no longer under human control, as could happen here.\n\nTechnology that assists human drivers \u2014 that\u2019s a great idea. But technology that pre-empts them and dumbs them down \u2014 that could be a very bad idea, indeed.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Eric Peters is a veteran automotive journalist and author of \u201cRoad Hogs\u201d and \u201cAutomotive Atrocities.\u201d Readers may write him at 721 Hummingbird Lane SE, Copper Hill, VA 24079 and visit his web site at www.EPautos.com.\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers.

In fact,\u00a0we have been ready for more than 100 years.\u00a0\n\nBefore we had cars, we had horses that pulled buggies. The horses did not need anyone to drive them. They were able to find their way home with little or no help from humans. Traveling without a driver is not a new idea. It is simply a better way to travel.\n\nCars first appeared in the early 1900s. As more people began driving, the\u00a0amount of car accidents went up. Modern technology has made driving safer, but too many people still get hurt in car accidents.\n\nToo Many Car Crashes\n\nOne study found that more than 32,000 people die each year in car accidents in the United States. Another 2.5 million people are hurt in accidents each year.\u00a0\n\nAlmost 95 out of every 100 of these accidents are caused by human mistakes. That figure comes from the\u00a0National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). This government agency works to make America's roads safe.\u00a0\n\nWe accept all of these accidents because cars are very useful. Self-driving\u00a0cars are even more useful. Self-driving\u00a0cars\u00a0allow people\u00a0to do other things instead of driving. People could text on their phones, work or just relax.\n\nSelf-driving cars use many forms of technology to drive themselves. Radar, cameras and other sensors help the car \"see\" the world around it. Computers drive the car from one place to another. People do not drive at all. These cars should soon be ready for everyday use.\n\nSelf-driving cars remove many of the human mistakes that cause accidents. They\u00a0also help people who cannot drive themselves get from place to place.\u00a0\n\nReady Or Not, Here They Come\n\nThen there is the fact that cars are expensive to buy. The gas that fuels cars is expensive too. People also have to buy insurance to protect themselves. A good insurance plan might pay for all the damage caused by an accident. Insurance can cost hundreds of dollars each month. That cost\u00a0that would be lower with self-driving cars.\u00a0\n\nIn some ways self-driving cars are already here. Some of the newest safety improvements in cars come very close to self-driving. New technology can control a car's speed and keep it in its lane. Technology can also help with parking. These are all steps toward a future full of\u00a0self-driving cars.\n\nOf course, self-driving cars will not be perfect. There will still be a few accidents. There will be some people who will never give up driving their cars themselves. Other people will live in areas where self-driving cars simply may not work.\u00a0\n\nSelf-driving cars help people in so many ways. It makes little difference if Americans are ready for them. Ready or not, self-driving cars will soon be here.\u00a0\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Robert W. Peterson is a teacher at Santa Clara University School of Law.

Backseat drivers sit in the back seat of a car and question everything a driver does in the front seat.\u00a0Backseat drivers try to control the car without actually driving it.\u00a0\n\nSoon it will be a backseat computer controlling our cars.\n\nThe self-driving car is no longer just a dream. It is already here. Bits and pieces of it, at least. Many new cars use cameras and sensors to park themselves. Others have computers that can stop the car without the driver even touching the brakes if the computers sense that an accident is about to happen.\n\nSaved By The Car?\n\nNext year, cars from General Motors will go even further. Some of the cars will\u00a0have vehicle-to-vehicle communication\u00a0technology, or V2V for short.\n\nV2V technology\u00a0allows cars to \"talk\" to each other through electronic signals. These cars will know where other cars are and how fast they are going. They will use V2V to avoid accidents.\n\nV2V should stop some common accidents. An example is when\u00a0a driver stops paying attention, runs a red light and hits another car.\n\nWith V2V, the driver would be saved by the car. It would brake the car at the light. The accident would never happen.\n\nTechnology like V2V in a car is good. However, taking all control from the driver could be terrible. A driver should always have some control of the car.\u00a0\n\nQuite simply, computers have problems.\u00a0Some kind of computer problem is bound to happen with a self-driving car. There will be many things that could cause a problem.\u00a0Driving in a hot summer,\u00a0a cold winter or a heavy rainstorm could all cause problems for\u00a0a car's computer.\n\nOver time, something will go wrong. When it does, the problem will be much worse if the driver cannot take control of the car. If the computer fails, the driver will need control to stop an accident from happening. \u00a0\n\nInsurance And Traffic Laws\n\nAnother problem is how\u00a0car insurance rules will change.\n\nInsurance protects the driver from paying for accidents.\u00a0If the driver no longer actually drives the car, he or she may not need insurance. Without insurance, paying for\u00a0accidents\u00a0caused by a self-driving car could be very complicated.\u00a0\n\nAn even bigger problem is traffic laws.\u00a0Sometimes it is\u00a0necessary to ignore a law in order to avoid an accident.\n\nFor example, cars cannot cross double yellow lines. It is against the law to do so. If a child runs into the path of a car, the only way to avoid the child might be to drive over those lines. A human would do that. A self-driving car might not. The car might not be able to ignore that law in order to\u00a0avoid an accident.\n\nTechnology is usually a good thing. However, it is a problem when technology is not under human control. That could happen with self-driving cars.\n\nTechnology that helps human drivers is a great idea. Technology that gets in their way could be a very bad idea.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Eric Peters is a car journalist and the writer of \u201cRoad Hogs\u201d and \u201cAutomotive Atrocities.\u201d Readers may write him at 721 Hummingbird Lane SE, Copper Hill, VA 24079.

Modern technology and safer car design have helped decrease the number of fatal crashes. However, the numbers still remain too high.\u00a0\n\nRemoving Human Error From Driving\n\nOne five-year study showed that\u00a0vehicular accidents killed more than 32,000 people each year in the United States. That is\u00a0more than double the number of people who died worldwide in the recent Ebola outbreak.\n\nNearly 95 percent of these\u00a0fatal accidents are caused by\u00a0mistakes by drivers. That figure comes from the\u00a0National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). This government agency works to make America's roads safe.\u00a0\n\nVehicular\u00a0accidents also send about 2.5 million injured people to hospitals\u00a0each year.\n\nWe accept all of these accidents because cars are very useful. Self-driving\u00a0cars are even more useful. Self-driving\u00a0cars\u00a0allow people\u00a0to do other things instead of driving.

These cars should soon be ready for everyday use.\n\nSelf-driving cars remove many of the human mistakes that cause accidents.\u00a0Self-driving cars can also help disabled and elderly people get from place to place on their own.\n\nSelf-Driving Cars Will Be Safer\n\nThen there is the fact that cars are expensive to buy. The insurance that people have to buy to protect themselves in case they get into an accident is not cheap either. A good insurance plan might pay for all the damages caused by an accident. However, that plan could cost hundreds of dollars each month. Self-driving cars would lower the cost of insurance.\u00a0\n\nIn some ways self-driving cars are already here.

There will be some people who will never give up their cars. Other people will live in areas where self-driving cars simply may not work. \u00a0\n\nSome lawmakers may try to stop self-driving cars from using our roads. They might be scared by the anger\u00a0that will come after the first accident caused by a\u00a0self-driving car. Others will see self-driving cars as a threat to their business.\n\nSelf-driving cars offer so many advantages that it makes little difference whether Americans are ready. Americans need to get ready. Self-driving cars will soon be here.\u00a0\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Robert W. Peterson is a professor of insurance law at Santa Clara University School of Law.

Backseat drivers sit in the back seat of a car and question every decision a driver makes in the front seat.\u00a0Backseat drivers try to control how the driver handles the car.\n\nCan you imagine a backseat computer doing the same thing? One you cannot turn off?\n\nThis\u00a0backseat computer is already in many cars, and it will soon control the driving for you.\n\nIt is the self-driving car, and it is no longer science fiction. It is already here. Bits and pieces of it, anyhow. Many new cars use cameras and sensors to park themselves. Others have systems that can completely stop the car without the driver even touching the brakes if they sense that an accident is about to happen.\n\nTaking The Technology Further\n\nNext year, General Motors will take this technology even further. Some of the automaker's cars will\u00a0have vehicle-to-vehicle communication\u00a0technology, or V2V for short.\n\nV2V technology\u00a0allows cars to \"talk\" to each other through electronic signals. These cars will be aware of other cars' locations and speeds. They will use V2V technology to avoid accidents. This could prevent situations where, for instance, car A runs a red light because its driver was not paying attention and strikes car B.\n\nWith V2V, the driver of car A would be saved by the car. Car A would automatically brake for the light and avoid striking car B.\n\nThese are some of the good features of self-driving cars. However, taking the driver out of the equation entirely, or relying too much on technology, can have a downside.\n\nAs anyone who owns a computer knows, computers develop glitches. A computer glitch is annoying when it happens at your desk. It could be deadly when it happens on the highway.\n\nSome kind of computer glitch is likely to happen with a self-driving car. The computer that controls the car will face many extremes that desk computers do not. High and low temperatures, vibrations caused by driving near large trucks, and water from rainstorms all affect cars. Any of these could cause problems for a car's computer.\n\nBut How Far Can It Go?\n\nOver time, something is likely to go wrong. If the human driver has become a passenger who cannot control the car, what will happen?\n\nIf there is an accident, who will be responsible? If the car is driving itself, can a driver be blamed for an accident?\u00a0Will the manufacturer of the car be to blame?\n\nAnother problem is how\u00a0car insurance rules will change.\n\nInsurance protects the driver from paying for accidents.\u00a0If the driver no longer actually drives the car, why should he or she be required to buy insurance?

Sometimes it is\u00a0necessary to ignore a law in order to avoid an accident.\n\nFor example, cars cannot cross double yellow lines. What if a child runs into the car\u2019s path?

The only people who can save him work for the U.S. space agency. The agency is called NASA.\n\nIn the movie, NASA asks other countries for help. Together they think of new ways to travel through space. They work together to save\u00a0the astronaut.\n\nThis is a lot like how real space travel works.\u00a0\n\nMars is a long way from Earth and no people have ever been there. NASA wants to change that.\n\nFirst Stop: Space Station\n\nNASA wants to send people to Mars. We have a plan to do this by the year 2040.\u00a0I currently work at NASA as a chief scientist.\u00a0It will not be easy and we will need help.\n\nThe plan begins with the International Space Station, or ISS. The ISS is a large space station and science lab. Fifteen countries help run it.\n\nThe ISS is close to Earth and not very far into space. Astronauts will soon have to travel beyond the ISS.\u00a0Each trip will take them farther from Earth and closer to Mars.\u00a0\n\nThere are also companies that work with NASA. Some companies send rockets with supplies to the ISS. Others will soon bring astronauts from Earth to the ISS.\n\nCompanies Help NASA\n\nThese companies do easy things for NASA. That lets NASA solve the harder problems about getting to Mars.\u00a0\n\nWe are not going to Mars just because we can. We are going to learn new things. What we learn about Mars will tell us more about life on Earth.\n\nWe know water was once on\u00a0Mars. Water helped create life on Earth. We want to know if water helped create life on Mars too. If so, we want to study it.\u00a0\n\nSmart People Will Team Up\n\nSending people to Mars will also make many smart people work together.\u00a0It will make them have new ideas. They will invent new technologies that can help people in space and on Earth.\n\nOne example is the water cleaning system used on the ISS. It can also make clean water on Earth. It helps many people who need clean water.\u00a0\n\nThe astronaut in \"The Martian\"\u00a0showed great courage. He explored Mars when he was all alone. He never gave up.

Directed by Ridley Scott, the movie is visually beautiful. It provides nail-biting entertainment while highlighting what humans can accomplish when we put our minds to it. It also offers a glimpse into what the future of space exploration could look like.\n\nNASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, provided technical help to the movie. Many of the scenes showcased technologies that we are working on today \u2013 from advanced spacesuits to methods for growing food in space. These technologies could one day be used to explore Mars in real life.\n\nNASA has set the ambitious goal of sending humans to Mars by the mid-2030s. In a recently released report, \u201cNASA\u2019s Journey to Mars: Pioneering Next Steps in Space Exploration,\u201d we outline what humankind must do to get there. The steps include continued research on the International Space Station (ISS), the space station and science lab that has been in orbit above Earth since 1998.\n\n\"The Proving Ground\"\n\nFrom there, we will need to move humans beyond low Earth orbit to what we call \u201cthe proving ground.\u201d That is the region of space near the moon. This will allow us to push the limits of our capabilities in a place from which astronauts can safely return home in a few days.\n\nThere is one thing \u201cThe Martian\u201d got wrong. Unlike in the film, human exploration of Mars will not be a NASA-dominated endeavor. People and resources from around the world will contribute to preparations to send humans to Mars. The journey itself will be pursued in partnership with other countries\u2019 space agencies and with the help of private businesses.\n\nAlready, agencies from around the world work together to expand our knowledge of space and the solar system. Tens of thousands of people from 15 countries have been involved in developing and operating the ISS. In addition to developing the technology needed to explore our solar system, we are carrying out critical research there on how to keep humans healthy in space for long periods of time.\n\nCompanies Play A Big Role\n\nThis collaboration continues through NASA's robotic spacecraft on Mars. Five countries contributed instruments aboard NASA's\u00a0Curiosity rover there.\u00a0Rovers like Curiosity reduce the risks of landing humans on Mars. They can provide a better understanding of the planet\u2019s environment and what resources it might provide to future explorers before a single human sets foot on the planet.\n\nAnother example is the service module for NASA\u2019s Orion spacecraft, provided by the European Space Agency. Orion is\u00a0the vehicle that will carry astronauts beyond the moon for the first time since the Apollo program ended in 1972.\n\nPrivate companies are also doing their part. SpaceX and Orbital ATK already transport supplies to the ISS. Boeing and SpaceX plan to start launching astronauts in 2018. We are also testing new technologies with private companies on the ISS, such as 3-D printers that could make space exploration more sustainable.\n\nWill We Find Life On Mars?\n\nWe are not pursuing a human journey to Mars just because we can. We are doing it because what we learn about the planet will tell us more about life on Earth.\n\nFrom a scientific point of view, we believe that Mars is the most likely place to find evidence of life beyond Earth. Water, which is critical to life, was stable on the surface of Mars for about a billion years. Based on what we know about evolution on Earth, life is likely to have arisen on Mars as well.\n\nHowever, Martian life-forms \u2013 if there are any \u2013 may not have evolved beyond the very simple, and very small, microbial level. That is why\u00a0we want to put astrobiologists, scientists who specialize in studying how life develops in the universe,\u00a0on Mars.\u00a0\n\nRecent evidence of liquid water on the surface of Mars also makes scientists wonder if life could have continued there. If so, these life forms may have moved underground as surface conditions became increasingly harsh.\n\nMaking Our World Better\n\nThere are also reasons for visiting Mars that go beyond the scientific. Sending humans to Mars is a challenge that will spark innovation and the development of new technologies. It has been estimated that every dollar spent at NASA adds about four dollars to the American economy. As President John F. Kennedy said in 1962, we don\u2019t do things like putting a man on the moon \u201cbecause they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills.\u201d\n\nThese efforts have real benefits for life on Earth as many of the recent technologies developed for space already have applications on Earth. The water purification system used on the ISS helps provide clean water in remote regions of Earth. Work on NASA\u2019s new Space Launch System and Orion capsule has led to faster ways to charge batteries. It has also aided the development of advanced manufacturing methods and lighter aircraft structures.\n\nFictional astronaut Mark Watney showed a steely resolve as he explored Mars in \u201cThe Martian.\u201d NASA is likewise resolved to lead an international effort to reach for new heights and learn the secrets of the Red Planet. In doing so, we will turn science fiction into science fact.\n\nEllen R.

SpaceX and Orbital ATK already transport supplies to the ISS as part of NASA\u2019s commercial cargo program, and Boeing and SpaceX plan to start launching astronauts in 2018. We are also testing new technologies with private companies on the ISS, such as 3-D printers that could make space exploration more sustainable.\n\nWe are not pursuing a human journey to Mars just because we can. We are doing it because what we learn about the planet will tell us more about life on Earth.\n\nFrom a scientific perspective, we believe that Mars is the most likely place to find evidence of life beyond Earth. Water, which is critical to life, was stable on the surface of Mars for about a billion years. Based on what we know about evolution on Earth, life is likely to have arisen on Mars as well.\n\nHowever, because Martian life-forms \u2013 if there are any \u2013 may not have evolved beyond the microbial level, we will likely need to put astrobiologists and geologists on the surface of Mars in order to find evidence of them. Recent evidence of liquid water on the surface of Mars also makes scientists wonder if life could have persisted, moving underground as surface conditions became increasingly inhospitable.\n\nThere are also reasons for visiting Mars that transcend the purely scientific. Sending humans to Mars is a challenge that will spark innovation and the development of new technologies and capabilities. It has been estimated that every dollar spent at NASA adds about four dollars to the American economy. As President John F. Kennedy once said, we don\u2019t do things like putting a man on the moon \u201cbecause they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills.\u201d\n\nThese efforts have real benefits for life on Earth. Indeed, many of the recent technologies developed for space already have practical applications on Earth. The water purification system used on the ISS is currently helping to provide clean water in remote regions. Work on NASA\u2019s new Space Launch System and Orion capsule has led to faster ways to charge batteries and to the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and lighter aircraft structures.\n\nJust as steely astronaut Mark Watney explored Mars in \u201cThe Martian,\u201d NASA is resolved to continue to lead an international effort to reach for new heights and learn the secrets of the Red Planet.

The U.S. space agency\u00a0does this with a mix of help from international partners and human ingenuity. Directed by Ridley Scott, the movie\u00a0highlights the great things humans can accomplish. It also offers\u00a0a glimpse into what the future of space exploration could look like.\n\nNASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, shared its technology to help make the film more realistic.\u00a0The spacesuits and methods for growing food in space in the film came from NASA. They\u00a0could one day be used to explore Mars in real life.\n\nNASA plans to send humans to Mars by the mid-2030s. In a report titled \u201cNASA\u2019s Journey to Mars: Pioneering Next Steps in Space Exploration,\u201d we outline what we must do to get there. The steps include continued research on the International Space Station (ISS), the space station and science lab that has been orbiting Earth since 1998.\n\nCountries And Companies\n\nFrom the ISS, we will need to send humans beyond low Earth orbit to \u201cthe proving ground.\" We call the region of space near the moon \"the proving ground\" because that is where we will push our limits. It is far enough from Earth that being there will be a challenge for our\u00a0astronauts. However, it\u00a0is also close enough that astronauts can safely return home in a few days.\n\nThere is one thing \u201cThe Martian\u201d got wrong. The film shows the human exploration of Mars as being run solely by NASA. That will not be the case in real life. People and technology from around the world will help send humans to Mars. The journey will be conducted with the help of\u00a0both other countries\u2019 space agencies and private businesses.\n\nAgencies from around the world already work together to study space and the solar system. Tens of thousands of people from 15 countries have been involved in operating the ISS. The research performed there will be used to\u00a0explore our solar system. We are also learning how to keep humans healthy in space.\n\nNew Views Of Our Planet\n\nNASA and its international partners also continue to explore Mars with robotic spacecraft. Five countries contributed instruments aboard NASA's\u00a0Curiosity rover.\u00a0Rovers like Curiosity reduce the risks of landing humans on Mars. They provide a better understanding of the planet before a single human sets foot there.\n\nPrivate companies are also doing their part. SpaceX and Orbital ATK already transport supplies to the ISS. Boeing and SpaceX plan to start launching astronauts in 2018. By letting others take care of these easier tasks, NASA is able to focus on solving the hardest problems of deep space flight.\n\nWe are not pursuing a human journey to Mars just because we can. We are doing it because what we learn about the planet will tell us more about life on Earth.\n\nWe believe Mars is the best place to find evidence of life beyond Earth. Water is necessary for life, and it once flowed on\u00a0Mars.\u00a0Based on what we know about the development of life on Earth, life is likely to have arisen on Mars as well.\n\nImproving Everyday Life\n\nHowever, Martian life-forms \u2013 if there are any \u2013 may have been very small and very simple microbes.\u00a0That is why\u00a0we will likely need astrobiologists\u00a0on Mars. Scientists who study how life develops in the universe will be the best people to study any signs of life found on Mars.\u00a0\n\nThere are also other reasons for visiting Mars. Sending humans to Mars is a challenge. It will spark new ideas and new technologies. President John F. Kennedy may have explained this best in 1962. Kennedy said we do not do things like sending men into space \u201cbecause they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills.\u201d\n\nThese efforts have real benefits for life on Earth. Indeed, many technologies developed for space have helped us on Earth. The water purification system used on the ISS also provides clean water in remote regions of Earth. Work on NASA\u2019s new Space Launch System has also led to faster ways to charge batteries.\u00a0\n\nFictional astronaut Mark Watney showed great resolve as he explored Mars in \u201cThe Martian.\u201d NASA is likewise resolved to lead an international effort to learn the secrets of the Red Planet.

NASA saves the astronaut, thanks to help from\u00a0other countries and some brilliant ideas by very smart people.\n\n\"The Martian\"\u00a0shows the great things humans can do. It also offers\u00a0an idea of what the future of space exploration could look like.\n\nMars is one of the closest planets\u00a0to Earth. No humans have ever been there in real life. However,\u00a0NASA now plans to send humans there by the mid-2030s. I work at NASA as a chief scientist. In a report titled \u201cNASA\u2019s Journey to Mars,\u201d we explain how to get there.\n\nFirst we must keep studying how humans live in outer space. We will do this aboard the International Space Station, or ISS. The ISS is a large space station and science lab. It has been in orbit around Earth since 1998.\n\nMany Nations Involved\n\nFrom the ISS, we will send humans farther out into space. Very slowly, the astronauts will learn how to travel farther away from Earth. Each trip they make will be one step farther from Earth. Each trip will bring them one step closer to Mars.\u00a0\n\nThere is one thing \u201cThe Martian\u201d got wrong. The movie shows the human exploration of Mars as being run only by NASA. That will not be the case in real life. People and technology from around the world will help NASA.

Boeing and SpaceX plan to start launching astronauts in 2018. If businesses can do these things, NASA can work on solving the hardest problems in getting to Mars.\n\nWe are not going to Mars just because we can. We are going because of what we can learn. What we learn about Mars will tell us more about life on Earth.\n\nWe believe Mars is the best place to find signs of life beyond Earth. One of the first signs of life is water. We know water once flowed on\u00a0Mars.\u00a0Based on what we know about life on Earth, life likely also formed on Mars. If it has, we want scientists on Mars to study any signs of life there.\u00a0\n\nNew Ideas, New Technology\n\nThere are also other reasons for visiting Mars. Sending humans to Mars will be hard. Many very smart people will need to work together.\u00a0They will need to have new ideas and invent new technologies. Many good things can happen when very smart people invent new technologies.\u00a0\n\nThe ISS is a great example of the benefits of space exploration. The water cleaning system created for the ISS does not just work in space. It can also clean water on Earth. Work on another NASA project has also led to faster ways to charge batteries.\u00a0\n\nThe astronaut in the movie \"The Martian\"\u00a0showed great courage on Mars. He never gave up hope, no matter what happened. NASA will also never give up on its plan to send humans to Mars.\u00a0And when the first human reaches Mars, we will turn science fiction into science fact.\n\nEllen R.

Photo: AP/Rich Pedroncelli\nPRO: Sanctuary cities should get no money from U.S.\nA sanctuary is a place of safety. A sanctuary city is an area that protects immigrants who are living in this country without permission. Sanctuary cities do not help the government send back these immigrants to their countries. There are more than 300 sanctuary areas nationwide. They are in cities like New York, counties like Cook County in Illinois and even whole states like California.\n\nSanctuary cities are dangerous to public safety. They are against government law. A group of lawmakers want to stop giving them money. It should have been done a long time ago.\n\nIn 2014, the government's Department of Homeland Security wanted to send home more than 9,000 criminals who entered the country without permission. They lived in areas that gave immigrants sanctuary. The criminals were released instead, according to the department\u2019s records.\u00a0\n\nMore than 2,000 of them went on to commit new crimes, including murder. Many of these criminals are still on the streets.\n\nA List Of Victims\n\nOne of the many American victims of sanctuary rules was Kathryn Steinle. She was killed last year by a criminal in San Francisco, California. The city had refused to turn him over to immigration officials to return to his home country.\n\nAnother victim was high school football star Jamiel Shaw Jr. of Los Angeles, California. He was murdered in 2008 by a gang member in the country without permission. The gang member was protected by Los Angeles\u2019 Special Order 40. It was one of the nation\u2019s first sanctuary laws.\n\nThe Remembrance Project keeps the stories of Steinle and Shaw and other Americans. They were killed by people who were living in the country without permission. Many of their murderers were protected by sanctuary cities.\n\nIn 1996, lawmakers in Washington, D.C., made a law that said cities cannot have sanctuary rules. The rules had made it much harder for the government to kick out immigrants in the country without permission. The law did not work because no one forced the cities to go along with it.\n\nThe best way to get cities to follow the law is to cut off money to cities and states that defy the law. Lawmakers have tried this in the past but were not successful.\n\n\"I Want You To Do Something\"\n\nIt may change. Representative John Culberson of Texas is a lawmaker. He recently wrote the attorney general, the top lawyer for the government. He demanded that sanctuary cities should not receive money from the government.\n\nCulberson pointed out that these communities are breaking the law.\n\nIn addition, the congressman made clear that he and other lawmakers mean what they say. This matters because the government gives money to different parts of the government when a spending budget is passed each year. Then those\u00a0government departments\u00a0give some money to states and cities.\u00a0The departments often\u00a0use the money for a different purpose than what the budget said.\u00a0\n\nLawmakers need to approve this, though. Culberson has said he would not agree to changes in spending until the government stops giving money to sanctuary cities. He plans to include a ban on sanctuary cities in the next government budget. It could set up a major fight. One group of lawmakers would work to send home criminals in the country without permission and other lawmakers would work to protect them.\n\nLaura Wilkerson's son, Joshua, was killed by a criminal in the country without permission. She told senators at a meeting last fall, \u201cI don\u2019t want the sympathy. I want you to do something.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s right, and doing something about sanctuary cities is long overdue.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Mark Krikorian is executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a research organization that examines the impact of immigration on the United States.\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers. Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of Tribune or Newsela.\nCON: Lawmakers should focus on creating hope, not hate\nFear is one of the strongest feelings. It drives us to avoid danger. The instinct is a reason that we have survived.\n\nFear can indeed make us aware of danger. It can also lead us to make bad choices that can hurt us.\n\nThis is why making people fearful is common in politics. Just pay attention to the messages coming out of the presidential election.\n\nPoliticians Playing On Our Fears\n\nCandidates and elected officials are taking advantage of fears that many Americans have about immigrants. They are especially focusing on immigrants who are in the United States illegally. These candidates are using fear to get people to vote for them.\n\nTheir message is so strong that it brings up our greatest human fear. It is the fear of the unknown. Unfortunately, fear of the unknown often turns into hate.\n\nDonald Trump is a Republican candidate for president. Republicans and Democrats are the two main political groups in America. Trump has said that immigrants are murderers. He has also promised to build a wall around the United States, and said the country should not allow Muslims to come to America. These extreme statements make people even more scared.\n\nTrump is not alone in using tough talk on immigrants. Almost every Republican candidate has ideas about immigrants that play on fear.\n\nThis tactic is not limited to the presidential election either. In a recent trip to the Southwest, I saw many ads for state candidates that use tough talk. The ads said things that made people feel afraid but were not true.\n\nLawmakers in Washington want to make a law that is based on fear. The law would not give money for police in states and cities that give sanctuary for immigrants.\n\nImmigrants Are Humans Too\n\nThe actions in Congress take advantage of two fears at once. The first is that some people are afraid of immigrants. The second is the fear immigrants themselves have. They are afraid of being sent home, of their families being split up, of losing their jobs.\n\nImmigrants are humans too. For many of them, their journey to the United States was a search for safety and hope.\n\nImmigrants who are in the United States without permission live a balancing act. They try to achieve their dreams. At the same time, they try to avoid their worst fears.\n\nSanctuary cities or states are not full of crime, as opponents want you to believe. They do not tell their police to check whether people are in this country with permission or not. Instead, they tell their police to spend more time on fighting and preventing crime.\n\nIt makes sense. What does not make sense is taking money away from the police to fight crime.\n\nWe are not even talking about that much money. The entire amount represents less than a tiny fraction of the budget. It is meaningless and mean-spirited, like a Trump rant.\n\nCongress should reject this approach that scares people. It should focus more on creating opportunity and hope for everyone living in the United States. It does not matter how they or their ancestors arrived in this country.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Don Kusler is the executive director of Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal advocacy organization (www.adaction.org).\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers.

They were released instead because of local sanctuary policies, according to the department\u2019s records.\u00a0\n\nMurderers Shielded By Sanctuary Cities\n\nMore than 2,000 of them went on to commit new crimes, including murder. These crimes also include sexual assault on young children, rape, burglary, assault, dangerous drug offenses and drunk driving. Many of them are still at large.\n\nOne of the many American victims of sanctuary policies was Kathryn Steinle. She was killed last year by a felon whom San Francisco, California, refused to turn over to immigration authorities to send him back to his home country.\n\nAnother was high school football star Jamiel Shaw Jr. of Los Angeles, California.

Many of their murderers were shielded by sanctuary cities.\n\nCongress prohibited local sanctuary policies in 1996 because they made it much harder for the federal government to deport immigrants in the country illegally. The law had no teeth, though, and was not enforced.\n\nThe best way to get states an cities to comply with the law is to use the power of the purse \u2014 cut off federal funding to state and local jurisdictions that continue to defy federal law. Half-hearted attempts have been made in the past to do this in budget bills, but none have been successful.\n\nA Congressman's Proposal\n\nThat may change. Republican Representative John Culberson of Texas is the chairman of the House subcommittee in charge of funding for the Department of Justice. He recently wrote the attorney general demanding, among other things, that sanctuary cities should not be eligible for three programs that give more than $1 billion in grants to state and local governments.\n\nAs he noted in his letter, \u201cCommunities that do not work with federal law enforcement officials, in violation of federal law, should not expect to receive federal grant funding.\u201d\n\nIn addition,\u00a0Culberson\u00a0made clear that he and Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama would use their authority over Justice Department spending to pressure President Barack Obama's administration. This matters because federal agencies often need to \u201creprogram\u201d funds. In other words, they use the money for a different purpose than specified in the original budget bill.\n\nThis can only be done with the prior approval of House and Senate committees. Culberson has said no reprogramming requests would be approved until sanctuary funding is cut off, and he has shown this is not an empty threat.\n\nThe current budget year ends Sept. 30, so it\u2019s at least possible that the Obama administration will somehow make it until then without having to go to Culberson for \u201creprogramming\u201d approval.\n\nBut if he keeps his word and includes a sanctuary cities ban in next year\u2019s budget bill, it could set up a conflict. Senate Democrats could choose to filibuster it, which means they can prevent a vote from taking place, or the president vetoes it.\n\nThat could actually be a useful fight to have, with one side of Congress working to deport criminals in the country illegally and the other working to protect them.\n\nIt's Long Overdue\n\nLaura Wilkerson, whose son, Joshua, was brutally murdered by a criminal in the country illegally, told a Senate hearing last fall, \u201cI don\u2019t want the sympathy.

Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of Tribune or Newsela.\nCON: End the fear-mongering and give all immigrants hope\nFear is among our strongest motivators and is, at its core, a survival instinct millions of years in the making.\n\nAnd while fear can indeed provide an awareness essential to survival, it can also be counterproductive and crippling.\n\nConsequently, fear-mongering is common in political communication. Just pay attention to the messages coming out of the numerous debates and campaign advertisements for the presidential election.\n\nOne of the most disturbing uses of fear is how candidates and elected officials are preying on the fears that many Americans have about immigrants, particularly immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nFanning The Flames Of Fear\n\nThe potency of these messages lies within arguably our greatest human fear, the fear of the unknown, which unfortunately often turns into hate.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump, for example, has called immigrants murderers and rapists, promised to build a wall around the United States, and called on the country to block the entry of all foreign Muslims. These rants fan the flames of the fear expressed in how many of us think and act.\n\nTrump is not alone in using tough talk on immigrants to seemingly provide the security that his followers seek. Nearly every Republican candidate has a hard-line immigration policy that plays on fear.\n\nThis tactic is not limited to the presidential campaign trail either. In a recent trip to the Southwest, I took note of the many campaign ads for state and local elections using the same ill-informed, fear-mongering, tough talk on immigrants.\n\nNot to be outdone, fear-peddlers in Washington too have introduced legislation in Congress. It is aimed at eliminating funding for, of all things, law enforcement in state and local governments that have been deemed sanctuaries for immigrants.\n\nThe effort in Congress in fact preys on two fears at once \u2014 the fear of immigrants and the fears immigrants themselves have: deportation, the splitting up of families, the decimation of livelihoods and more.\n\nNo Havens Of Lawlessness\n\nImmigrants are humans too. For many of them, whether here officially or unofficially, their journey to the United States was born out of a desire for survival and a search for security and hope.\n\nEvery waking moment and over many sleepless nights, immigrants who are staying illegally in the United States are living out a balancing act. They try to achieve their dreams, while at the same time avoid their worst fears.\n\nSo-called sanctuary cities or states are not havens of lawlessness, as opponents would have you believe. They simply do not put the time-consuming business of checking the legal status of immigrants at the top of their law enforcement priorities. Instead, they leave more time for fighting and preventing more critical criminal matters.\n\nImmigrants living in these jurisdictions illegally are thus provided a tiny bit of breathing room and a chance to put more emphasis on their hopes than on their fears.\n\nFor this humane and frankly wise criminal justice practice, the merchants of fear in Congress want to strip cities or states of money for homeland security activities.\n\nWe are not even talking about that much money, because the funds in question represent less than half of 1 percent of the overall budgets in the largest areas. Instead, the whole exercise is nothing more than a legislative version of a Trump rant.\n\nCongress should reject this alarmist approach and focus more on creating opportunity and hope for everyone living in the United States, no matter what their citizenship status is.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Don Kusler is the executive director of Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal advocacy organization (www.adaction.org).\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers.

Culberson successfully used this tool last year to get the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to drop a proposed ban on a certain kind of ammunition sought by gun-control advocates.\n\nThe current fiscal year ends Sept. 30, so it\u2019s at least possible that the Obama administration will somehow make it until then without having to go to Culberson for \u201creprogramming\u201d approval.\n\nBut if he keeps his word and includes a sanctuary cities ban in next year\u2019s budget bill, it could set up a conflict if Senate Democrats choose to filibuster it or the president vetoes it.\n\nThat could actually be a useful fight to have, with one side working to deport criminals in the country illegally and the other working to protect them.\n\nLaura Wilkerson, whose son, Joshua, was brutally murdered by a criminal in the country illegally, told a Senate hearing last fall: \u201cI don\u2019t want the sympathy.

Just take stock in the rhetoric coming out of the numerous debates and campaign advertisements related to the upcoming presidential election.\n\nOne of the most disturbing uses of fear is playing out as candidates and elected officials prey on the reactionary fears that many Americans have about immigrants, particularly immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nThe potency of these messages lies within arguably our greatest human fear, the fear of the unknown, which unfortunately often turns into hate.\n\nDonald Trump, for example, has called immigrants murderers and rapists, promised to build a wall around the United States, and called on the country to block the entry of all foreign Muslims. These reactionary rants fan the flames of the fear dominant in how many of us think and act.\n\nTrump is not alone in using tough talk on immigrants to purportedly provide the security followers seek. Seemingly every Republican candidate has a hardline immigration policy that plays on fear.\n\nThis tactic is not limited to the presidential campaign trail either. In a recent trip to the Southwest, I took note of the many state-level campaign ads using the same ill-informed, fear-mongering, tough talk on immigrants.\n\nNot to be outdone, fear-peddlers in Washington too have introduced legislation in Congress aimed at eliminating funding for, of all things, law enforcement of state and local governments that have been deemed sanctuaries for immigrants.\n\nThe congressional effort in fact preys on two fears at once: the fear of immigrants and the fears immigrants themselves have: deportation, the splitting up of families, the decimation of livelihoods and more.\n\nImmigrants are humans too. For many, whether here through official or unofficial channels, their journey to the United States was born out of a desire for survival and a search for security and hope.\n\nEvery waking moment, sleepless nights included, immigrants living illegally in the United States are balancing their thoughts between achieving their dreams and avoiding their worst fears.\n\nSo-called sanctuary cities or states are not havens of lawlessness, as opponents would have you believe. These jurisdictions simply do not put the time-consuming business of profiling and immigration status checks at the top of their law enforcement priorities, leaving more time for fighting and preventing more critical criminal matters.\n\nImmigrants living in these jurisdictions illegally are thus provided a tiny bit of breathing room and a chance to put more emphasis on their hopes rather than their fears.\n\nFor this humane and frankly prudent criminal justice practice, the merchants of fear in Congress want to strip cities or states of money intended to bolster homeland security activities.\n\nWe are not even talking about that much money. The funds in question represent less than half of 1 percent of the overall budgets in the largest jurisdictions. Instead, the whole exercise is nothing more than a legislative version of a Trump rant.\n\nCongress should reject this alarmist approach to governance and focus more on creating opportunity and hope for everyone living in the United States, citizenship status aside.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Don Kusler is the executive director of Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal advocacy organization (www.adaction.org).\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers.

The cities will not help the government send them back home.\n\nThey are called sanctuary cities. A sanctuary is a place of safety. These sanctuary cities are dangerous, though. A group of lawmakers want to stop giving these cities money. They should have done it a long time ago.\n\nThere are more than 300 sanctuary areas across the country. They are in cities like New York. Not all of them are cities, though. Some are in counties like Cook County in Illinois and even whole states like California.\n\nThe Remembrance Project\n\nIn 2014, the government wanted to send home more than 9,000 criminals who entered the country without permission. They lived in sanctuary areas. The cities let the criminals go instead, says the government.\n\nMore than 2,000 of them did new crimes. Some of them killed other people. Many of these criminals are still on the streets.\n\nKathryn Steinle was one of the victims of sanctuary rules. She was killed last year by a criminal in San Francisco, California. The city had refused to turn him over to the government. He should have been sent back to his home country.\n\nAnother victim was high school football star Jamiel Shaw Jr. He was killed in 2008 in\u00a0Los Angeles, California. His killer was also in the country without permission. Los Angeles has one of the country's first sanctuary laws.\n\nThe Remembrance Project tells the stories of Steinle and Shaw and other Americans. They were killed by people in the country without permission. Many of their murderers were protected by sanctuary cities.\n\nIn 1996, lawmakers outlawed sanctuary rules. The lawmakers made a new law, which did not work. States and cities did not follow it.\n\nTime To Do Something\n\nSome lawmakers say sanctuary cities should not get government money.\n\nRepresentative John Culberson of Texas is a lawmaker. He wrote a letter to the attorney general, the top government lawyer.\n\nCulberson said that these cities are breaking the law. He said they should stop getting money from the government. His idea could start a fight. Some lawmakers would work to send home criminals in the country without permission. Other lawmakers would work to protect them.\n\nLaura Wilkerson's son was named Joshua. He was killed by a criminal in the country without permission. She told lawmakers they should not feel sorry for her. She just wants them to do something.\n\nShe is right.\n\nIt is time to do something about sanctuary cities.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Mark Krikorian is executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies.

It makes us avoid danger. Fear is one of the reasons humans have not died out.\n\nFear can also lead us to make bad choices.\n\nPoliticians make people feel afraid. Just pay attention to the presidential election.\n\nTough Talk On Immigrants\n\nCandidates are people running for election. Candidates and officials are talking about immigrants\u00a0often. They are people who came from other countries. Americans have many fears about immigrants. They are especially worried about immigrants in the country without permission. Candidates are using fear to get people to vote for them.\n\nTheir message is very strong. It brings up our greatest human fear. It is the fear of the unknown. Unfortunately, people often hate what they do not understand.\n\nDonald Trump is a Republican candidate for president. Republicans and Democrats are the two main political groups in America. He said that immigrants are killers. He has also promised to build a wall around the United States. He said we should not allow Muslims to come here from other countries. Muslims are members of the religion Islam. Trump is scaring people.\n\nTrump is not alone. Other Republicans are using tough talk on immigrants. They are playing on people's fears.\n\nLawmakers want to make a new law. The law would not give money for police in some states and cities. These places give sanctuary to immigrants.\u00a0\n\nThis law is based on two different fears. First, some people are afraid of immigrants. The second is that immigrants have their own fears. They are afraid of being sent home. They are afraid of their families being split up. They are afraid of losing their jobs.\n\nImmigrants are humans too. They came to America to follow their dreams.\n\nCreate Hope, Not Hate\n\nSome people say sanctuary cities or states are full of crime. It is not true. Their police spend more time on fighting and preventing crime. They spend less time checking whether people are here with permission.\n\nIt makes sense. What does not make sense is taking money away from the police.\n\nWe are not even talking about that much money. The amount is very small.\n\nThese kinds of laws scare people.

Photo: AP/Rich Pedroncelli\nPRO: Giving money to sanctuary cities has got to stop\nSanctuary cities are a menace to public safety. A recent effort in the House of Representatives to cut their funding is long overdue.\n\nThere are more than 300 sanctuary areas nationwide. They are in cities like New York, counties like Cook County in Illinois and even whole states like California. Sanctuary cities protect immigrants who are living in this country illegally. Officials of these areas refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities, and instead of deporting them to their home countries, they release criminals back onto the streets.\n\nGiving Sanctuary To Criminals?\n\nIn 2014, the federal Department of Homeland Security wanted to deport more than 9,000 criminals who entered the country illegally. They were released instead because of local sanctuary policies, according to the department\u2019s records.\u00a0\n\nMore than 2,000 of them went on to commit new crimes, including murder, burglary, assault, dangerous drug offenses and drunk driving. Many of these criminals are still on the streets.\n\nOne of the many American victims of sanctuary policies was Kathryn Steinle. She was killed last year by a criminal. San Francisco, California, had refused to turn him over to immigration authorities to send him back to his home country.\n\nAnother victim was high school football star Jamiel Shaw Jr. of\u00a0Los Angeles, California.\u00a0He was murdered in 2008 by a gang member in the country illegally and protected by Los Angeles\u2019 Special Order 40, one of the nation\u2019s first sanctuary laws.\n\nThe Remembrance Project preserves the stories of Steinle and Shaw and other Americans killed by those in the country illegally. Many of their murderers were protected by sanctuary cities.\n\nThe Power Of The Purse\n\nCongress made local sanctuary policies illegal in 1996, but the law had no penalty and was not enforced.\n\nThe best way to get cities to go along with the law is to use the power of the purse. The government should cut off money to areas that continue to defy federal law. Lawmakers have made half-hearted attempts in the past to do this, but none have been successful.\n\nThat may change. Republican Representative John Culberson of Texas is the chairman of the House subcommittee in charge of funding for the Department of Justice. He recently wrote the attorney general, the top lawyer for the government. He demanded, among other things, that sanctuary cities should not get any money from three programs that give more than $1 billion to state and local governments.\n\nAs he noted in his letter, \u201cCommunities that do not work with federal law enforcement officials, in violation of federal law,\" should not get any money.\n\nIn addition, the congressman made clear that he and Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama would pressure the government. This matters because federal agencies often need to \u201creprogram\u201d funds. In other words, they use the money for a different purpose than specified in the spending budgets passed each year.\n\nAny changes to how government departments spend money can only be done with the approval of lawmakers. Culberson has said he would not approve any reprogramming requests until the government stops giving money to sanctuary cities. He has shown this is not empty threat and plans to include a ban on sanctuary cities in the next government budget. It could set up a major conflict, which could actually be a useful fight to have. One group of lawmakers would work to deport criminals in the country illegally and another group would work to protect them.\n\n\"Do Something\"\n\nLaura Wilkerson's son, Joshua, was brutally murdered by a criminal in the country illegally. She told senators at a hearing last fall, \u201cI don\u2019t want the sympathy. I want you to do something.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s right, and doing something about the scandal of sanctuary cities is long overdue.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Mark Krikorian is executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonpartisan research organization that examines the impact of immigration on the United States.\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers.

The instinct is, at its core, a reason that we have survived.\n\nAnd while fear can indeed make us aware of danger, it can also lead us to make bad choices and hurt us.\n\nConsequently, politicians commonly try to make people afraid. Just pay attention to the messages coming out of the debates and campaign advertisements for the presidential election.\n\nThe Fear Of The Unknown\n\nOne of the most disturbing uses of fear is how candidates and elected officials are taking advantage of feelings that many Americans have about immigrants. These politicians are especially focusing on immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nThe strength of these messages evokes our greatest human fear, the fear of the unknown. Unfortunately, fear of the unknown often turns into hate.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump, for example, has called immigrants murderers and rapists. He has also promised to build a wall around the United States, and said all foreign Muslims should be kept out. These hateful speeches fan the flames of our worst fears about safety.\n\nTrump is not alone in using tough talk on immigrants to make it sound like he will provide security. Seemingly every Republican candidate has a hard-line immigration policy that plays on fear.\n\nThis tactic is not limited to the presidential election either. In a recent trip to the Southwest, I saw many campaign ads for state elections using the same untrue, fear-mongering, tough talk on immigrants.\n\nNot to be outdone, fear-mongering lawmakers in Washington, D.C., have introduced legislation in Congress. It would end funding for, of all things, law enforcement of state and local governments that give sanctuary to immigrants.\u00a0\n\nThe effort in Congress in fact takes advantage of two fears at once. The first is the fear of immigrants. The second is the fears that immigrants themselves feel: deportation, the splitting up of families, the destruction of livelihoods and more.\n\nSearching For Safety And Hope\n\nImmigrants are humans too. For many of them, whether here officially or unofficially, their journey to the United States was born out of a desire for survival and a search for safety and hope.\n\nDuring their every waking moment, immigrants who are illegally in the United States live a balancing act. They try to achieve their dreams, while at the same time avoid their worst fears.\n\nSo-called sanctuary cities or states are not wild and lawless, as opponents would have you believe. These areas simply do not put checking the legal status of immigrants at the top of their priority list. Instead, the police spend more time fighting and preventing crime.\n\nImmigrants living there illegally get a tiny bit of breathing room. They also get a chance to follow their hopes rather than their fears.\n\nThis is humane and makes sense. The merchants of fear in Congress want to strip cities or states of money for crime-fighting activities.\n\nWe are not even talking about that much money. The entire amount represents less than half of 1 percent of the overall budgets in the largest areas. It is meaningless and nothing more than a law that would mimic the hate speech of Trump.\n\nCongress should reject this alarmist approach and focus more on creating opportunity and hope for everyone living in the United States. It does not matter how they or their ancestors arrived in this country.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Don Kusler is the executive director of Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal advocacy organization (www.adaction.org).\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers.

After all, 12 people have walked on the surface of the Moon, but only three have been to the deepest part of the sea. As we learn more about\u00a0the Earth's oceans,\u00a0it is becoming clear that we have caused more damage to them than we realized.\n\nA recent study found that fishing catches have been substantially underestimated for years. This should grab the attention of regional fisheries management organizations, which oversee commercial fishing in the high seas. It is also significant news for those monitoring compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). The CMS is an international environmental treaty that covers endangered migratory species. Such species regularly travel through waters controlled by multiple nations and so they need to be protected by one set of international standards.\n\nAccording to the CMS, great white sharks are badly in need of protection, as are several\u00a0species closely related to sharks. The latter include\u00a0five species of sawfish and 11 species of ray.\u00a0\n\nPreserve The Apex Predators\n\nCMS meetings on migratory sharks are set to take place this month in San Jose, Costa Rica. The meetings represent an important opportunity to ensure the conservation of these species, so that they can continue to fulfill their critical ecological role as apex predators. As apex predators, sharks are among the animals that are at the top of the food chain; they help keep other animal populations from growing too large.\n\nIn 2010, 39 nations signed the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks. Despite being legally non-binding, the memorandum represents an important attempt to set limits on shark fishing, in order to ensure the health of various shark populations.\n\nHowever, as the recent study on fishing catches underscores, we often lack the accurate data needed to determine what level of consumption is sustainable. Without it, the precautionary principle \u2014 if in doubt, don\u2019t do it \u2014 should be applied. The problem is that the absence of reliable data can make the need to protect a species seem more abstract and less urgent. The uncertainty and vagueness weaken governments\u2019 capacity to resist other more immediate demands, especially the need to protect the livelihoods of fishermen and others.\n\nOver-Fishing Endangers Sharks\n\nIn the meantime, consumption of the oceans\u2019 resources continues to surge. Over the last two generations, as the world population has doubled to 7.3 billion, the amount of fish taken from the oceans each year has grown even faster, from 20 million metric tons in 1950 to 77 million in 2010. Furthermore, these are only the official figures. They do not account for illegal, unregulated and unreported catches.\n\nWhile sharks are commercially valuable, few fishing operations are primarily focused on catching them. Instead, most sharks are caught in nets targeting other fish, usually tuna. For that reason, there are few regulations specifically covering sharks. The absence of clear regulation has made it difficult to control the extent of shark fishing.\n\nThe nets that modern fisheries employ today are massive and the entire process of fishing has become industrialized. Factory ships and modern technologies have enabled the massive scaling up of catches to satisfy demand not only locally, but in distant markets as well. Given this, the addition of so many species to the endangered list in recent years should come as no surprise.\n\nShark Sanctuaries Vs. Shark Finning\n\nSome nations that have signed the Memorandum of Understanding, including certain Pacific island states, have declared their national waters to be shark sanctuaries. These countries have established areas where all fishing is prohibited. For their part, Australia, New Zealand and the United States have begun to develop efforts to monitor and manage fish stocks.\n\nFurthermore, there has been an outcry against the wasteful practice of shark finning, in which only the fin \u2014 considered the most tasty part of a shark \u2014 is harvested. The European Union now requires that all sharks are brought to shore intact, thereby preventing the removal of fins from sharks at sea and the disposal overboard of their less valuable bodies. This has been reinforced by the Chinese government\u2019s pledge not to serve shark fin soup, considered a delicacy, at official banquets. Even freight companies and airlines have been spurred to act. A growing number are now refusing to transport shark fins.\n\nWhile such progress should be applauded, there is a long way to go. For example, efforts must be made to address bycatch, or the trapping of sharks in nets intended for other fish. The key is for all interested parties \u2014 from fishermen and conservationists to governments and international bodies \u2014 to work together.\n\nWorth More Alive Than Dead\n\nThe negative economic impact of limiting shark fishing is not nearly as large as one might expect. In many cases, it could be more than offset by other kinds of commercial activities that take advantage of live sharks. The thriving ecotourism operations in the Maldives, Kenya, South Africa, Fiji and some Central American and Caribbean countries are a case in point. As a tourist draw, seen at close quarters in its natural setting, a manta ray can be worth thousands of dollars. Dead on a slab on the docks, its flesh and gills fetch a fraction of that amount.\n\nThe short-term thinking that slows down environmental conservation efforts today could prove devastating; indeed, to some extent, it already has. If we continue to damage critical ecosystems, they will soon become unfixable. Only with an urgent and cooperative effort to preserve marine ecosystems will the oceans be able to continue to feed \u2014 and fascinate \u2014 the world for generations to come.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "700L": "Opinion: Sharks need protection from people before it's too late\nBy Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n02.26.16\n\nActivists place a fake shark fin in Rome's Trevi fountain during a protest against finning, Nov. 17, 2012.

Only three have been to the deepest part of the sea.\u00a0\n\nScientists are now starting to learn more about the Earth's oceans. The news is not good. It turns out we have caused more damage to the oceans than we thought.\n\nA new study shows we have fished the oceans much more heavily than anyone realized. Many kinds of fish are in danger of disappearing.\u00a0\n\nMany of the world's countries have come together to try to deal with the problem. The countries signed a treaty. It is called the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).\u00a0\n\nThe CMS covers endangered migratory fish. Such fish travel long distances through waters controlled by many different nations. They need to be protected by one set of laws.\n\nAccording to the CMS, several kinds of sharks are seriously endangered. They are in danger of dying out completely unless fishing is controlled.\u00a0\n\nKeep Nature In Balance\n\nSharks might not seem worth saving. After all, they are frightening beasts. In fact, they are very important to the oceans' health. Without these great hunters, there would be too many smaller fish. Sharks help keep nature in balance.\n\nLater this month, leaders from many countries will meet in San Jose, Costa Rica. They will try to figure out ways to protect sharks.\u00a0\n\nIn 2010, 39 nations signed the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks. The purpose was to set limits on shark fishing. The countries agreed that only a certain amount of fishing would be allowed. Anything more could cause some kinds of sharks to die out.\n\nHowever, there is one big problem. Scientists simply do not have enough information.\u00a0\n\nNo one really knows how much fishing is going on. No one really knows how many of certain fish are left. For that reason, it is hard to set the right limits.\n\nOne thing is sure, though. We are fishing more and more. Fishermen today take more than three times as much fish from the oceans each year than they did in 1950.\u00a0\n\nIn part, this is because there are many more people in the world today. Another reason is that modern fishing uses huge nets and giant boats. It is no wonder that so many kinds of fish are now in danger.\n\nSome nations no longer allow shark fishing in their national waters. The United States has not gone that far. However, it is beginning to try to figure out how to protect sharks.\n\nA Ban On Shark Finning\n\nIn some parts of the world, shark finning is no longer allowed. Shark finning is a wasteful kind of fishing in which only the fin is kept. The fin is\u00a0the tastiest and most expensive part of a shark. Many Asians like to eat it in soups.\u00a0\n\nIn many European countries,\u00a0all sharks now must be brought to shore whole. The new law stops fishermen from slicing the fins off at sea. Before, they would do that and throw the rest of the body into the ocean.\u00a0\n\nNow these fishermen are less interested in catching sharks. They do not want to be stuck with the whole body since most of it is not worth much.\n\nThere is a long way to go, though. Many sharks are still in real danger. To save them, everyone must work together, including fishermen.

But it now seems that we know even less about the oceans than we thought \u2013 and we may well have been doing even more damage than we realized.\n\nA recent study found that fishing catches have been substantially underestimated for years. This should grab the attention of both regional fisheries management organizations, which oversee commercial fishing in the high seas, and those monitoring compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), which covers endangered migratory species.\n\nAccording to the CMS, the species demanding the strictest protection today \u2013 listed in Appendix I \u2013 include great white sharks, five species of sawfish, and 11 species of ray. The CMS meetings on migratory sharks, set to take place this month in San Jose, Costa Rica, represent an important opportunity for advancing regulations to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of these species, so that they can continue to fulfill their critical ecological role as apex predators.\n\nAt their last conference, held in Quito, Ecuador, in 2014, the CMS parties added several shark species, the protection of which governments are encouraged to secure through the negotiation of international agreements. One such agreement, reached in 2010 and so far signed by 39 parties, is the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks. Despite being legally non-binding, the initiative provides an important forum to reach agreement on policies ensuring that any exploitation of migratory shark populations is sustainable.\n\nBut, as the recent study on fishing catches underscores, we often lack the accurate data needed to determine what level of consumption is sustainable. Without it, the precautionary principle \u2013 if in doubt, don\u2019t do it \u2013 should be applied.

It is thus easier for sharks to slip through the gaps in international law than to elude fishermen\u2019s nets \u2013 especially the massive specialized nets that fisheries employ nowadays.\n\nIndeed, unlike the artisanal fisherman of the past, factory ships and modern technologies have enabled the massive scaling up of catches to satisfy demand not only locally, but in distant markets as well. Given this, the addition of so many species to the endangered list in recent years should come as no surprise.\n\nIn this challenging environment, initiatives like the Memorandum of Understanding become even more crucial as a means of encouraging (often region-specific) action. Some signatories, including certain Pacific island states, have declared their huge exclusive economic zones to be shark sanctuaries and have established areas where all fishing is prohibited. For their part, Australia, New Zealand and the United States have created observer schemes and systems to assess and manage fish stocks.\n\nFurthermore, in response to the outcry at the wasteful practice of shark finning, the European Union now requires that all sharks are landed intact, thereby preventing the removal of fins from sharks at sea and the disposal overboard of their less valuable bodies. This has been reinforced by the Chinese government\u2019s pledge not to serve shark fin soup, considered a delicacy, at official banquets. Even freight companies and airlines have been spurred to act, with a growing number now refusing to transport shark fins.\n\nWhile such progress should be applauded, there is a long way to go. For example, efforts must be made to address bycatch (the trapping of sharks in nets intended for other fish, especially tuna). The key is for all interested parties \u2013 from fisherman and conservationists to governments and international forums \u2013 to work together through the Memorandum of Understanding and similar initiatives.\n\nThe adverse economic impact implied by such efforts is not nearly as large as one might expect; in many cases, it could be more than offset by other kinds of commercial activities that take advantage of live sharks. The thriving ecotourism operations in the Maldives, Kenya, South Africa, Fiji and some Central American and Caribbean countries are a case in point. As a tourist draw, seen at close quarters in its natural habitat, a manta ray can be worth thousands of dollars; dead on a slab at the quayside, its flesh and gills fetch a fraction of that.\n\nThe short-term thinking that impedes environmental conservation efforts today could prove devastating; indeed, to some extent, it already has. If we continue to deplete critical ecosystems, they will soon become unable to regenerate. Only with a concerted, cooperative and urgent effort to preserve marine ecosystems and protect the livelihoods of those who depend on them will the oceans be able to continue to feed \u2013 and fascinate \u2013 the world for generations to come.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "1060L": "Opinion: We must do more to protect sharks or they will become extinct\nBy Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n02.26.16\n\nActivists place a fake shark fin in Rome's Trevi fountain during a protest against finning, Nov. 17, 2012.

After all, 12 people have walked on the surface of the Moon, but only three have been to the deepest part of the sea.\u00a0\n\nAs we learn more about the Earth's oceans, the news is not good. It is now becoming clear that we have caused more damage to them than we realized.\n\nA recent study found that we have fished the oceans much more heavily than was previously realized. Many marine species may be in danger of disappearing.\u00a0\n\nThe United Nations Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) is one important attempt to deal with the crisis. The CMS is an international environmental treaty that covers endangered migratory species. Such species regularly travel through waters controlled by many different nations. Because of this, they need to be protected by one set of international standards.\n\nAccording to the CMS, great white sharks are seriously endangered, as are several\u00a0species closely related to sharks. The latter include\u00a0five species of sawfish and 11 species of ray.\u00a0\n\nKeep Sharks Atop The Food Chain\n\nCMS meetings on migratory sharks are set to take place this month in San Jose, Costa Rica. The meetings represent an important opportunity to ensure the conservation of these species. Sharks need to be preserved so that they can continue to fulfill their critical ecological role as apex predators. Apex predators are at the top of the food chain. They help keep nature in balance by preventing other animal populations from growing too large.\n\nIn 2010, 39 nations signed the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks. The memorandum document is just an agreement, not a set of binding laws. However, it is an important attempt to set limits on shark fishing, in order to ensure the health of various shark populations.\n\nHowever, we often lack enough accurate information to determine how much fishing can safely be allowed. The absence of reliable information can make the need to protect a species seem less urgent and less real. Governments then more easily give way to calls to not impose limits on fishing. Many people oppose fishing limits because they fear they will lead to lost jobs and income.\n\nOver-Fishing Endangers The Sharks\n\nIn the meantime, our consumption of the ocean's fish continues to surge. Over the last two generations, the amount of fish taken from the oceans each year has grown from 20 million metric tons in 1950 to 77 million in 2010. Furthermore, these are only the official figures. They do not account for unregulated and unreported catches.\n\nWhile sharks are commercially valuable, few fishing operations are primarily focused on catching them. Instead, most sharks are caught in nets targeting other fish, usually tuna. For that reason, there are few regulations specifically covering sharks. The absence of clear regulation has made it difficult to control the extent of shark fishing.\n\nThe nets that modern fisheries use today are massive and the entire process of fishing has become large scale. Huge ships are harvesting gigantic quantities of fish. Given this, the addition of so many species to the endangered list in recent years should come as no surprise.\n\nSome nations that have signed the Memorandum of Understanding have banned shark fishing in their national waters. These countries, which include several Pacific island states,\u00a0have established areas where all fishing is forbidden. For their part, Australia, New Zealand and the United States have begun to develop efforts to better manage fish stocks.\n\nSay \"Finis\" To Shark Finning\n\nFurthermore, there has been an outcry against the wasteful practice of shark finning. Shark finning is a kind of fishing in which only the fin \u2014 considered the tastiest part of a shark \u2014 is harvested. The European Union now requires that all sharks are brought to shore whole. The law prevents the slicing off of fins at sea and the disposal overboard of the less valuable shark bodies. Even freight companies and airlines have been spurred to act. A growing number are now refusing to transport shark fins.\n\nWhile such progress should be applauded, there is a long way to go. For example, efforts must be made to address bycatch, or the trapping of sharks in nets intended for other fish. The key is for everyone concerned to work together, including fishermen.\n\nWhile limiting shark fishing could cause some loss of income for the fishing industry, the loss would not be that great. In addition, there is money to be made from commercial activities that take advantage of live sharks. Thriving marine tourism operations in the Maldives, Kenya, South Africa, Fiji and some Central American and Caribbean countries are a case in point. A shark seen\u00a0in its natural setting\u00a0can be worth thousands of dollars, as tourists are willing to pay for the experience. Dead on a slab on the docks, it is worth a fraction of that amount.\n\nIf we continue to damage our oceans, they will soon become ruined beyond repair. We must all work together so that the oceans will be able to continue to feed \u2014 and fascinate \u2014 the world for generations to come.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "480L": "Opinion: Sharks need our help to live\nBy Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n02.26.16\n\nActivists place a fake shark fin in Rome's Trevi fountain during a protest against finning, Nov. 17, 2012.

Some kinds may not be around much longer.\n\nSharks may be scary, but they are very important. They hunt smaller fish. Without them, there would be too many small fish.\n\nBig Problem: Shark Fin Soup\n\nThe problem is that people like to eat sharks.\u00a0Shark fin soup is very popular. Many people in Asia like to eat it.\u00a0The fin sticks out from a shark's body. It helps the shark move through water.\n\nLeaders from many countries will meet soon. They are getting together in San Jose, Costa Rica. They will talk about ways to help sharks.\u00a0\n\nThe leaders will set a limit on shark fishing. Anything more would be too much fishing.\n\nThere is one big problem. Scientists do not know enough.\u00a0No one knows how much fishing is going on. No one knows how many sharks are left. It is hard to set the right limit without knowing those things.\n\nOne thing is sure. We are fishing more and more. Fishermen today catch three times as many fish as they did in 1950.\u00a0\n\nSharks In Danger Of Dying Out\n\nThings have gotten better for sharks in some places. Some countries no longer let anyone fish for shark. But the United States still does.\n\nShark finning is no longer allowed in parts of Europe. Shark finning is a wasteful kind of fishing. Only the shark's fin is kept. The rest is tossed back into the water.\u00a0\n\nFishermen like shark finning because the fin is what people want. Fishermen do not get much money for the rest of the shark. It is easier to just throw it away. Now European fishermen cannot do that anymore.\n\nSome fishermen have stopped fishing for sharks. Keeping the body is too much trouble.\n\nThose changes have helped, but they are not enough. There is still much more to do. Fishermen, scientists and leaders must work together.\u00a0If they do not, some kinds of sharks will die out.

The author of this article discusses whether animals should be referred to as \"who\" or \"that.\" Photo: AP Photo/Aung Shine Oo\nMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014\u00a0Last month, a cow had its 15 minutes of fame after\u00a0escaping from a slaughterhouse in New York City and trotting down a busy street. For animal lovers, the story has a happy ending. The cow was captured and taken to a sanctuary, where he will live out the rest of his life.\n\nTo me, however, the most interesting aspect of the story was the language that news reporters used to talk about the animal. The New York Times had a headline that read: \u201cCow Who Escaped New York Slaughterhouse Finds Sanctuary.\u201d The Times chose the word \"who\" rather than \"that\" or \"which\" to refer to the cow.\u00a0\n\nHow Now Escaped Cow?\n\nThe distinction between \"the cow who escaped\" and\u00a0\u201cthe cow that escaped\u201d might seem like a small one, but it makes a difference in how we think about animals.\u00a0\"Who\" is used for people, as\u00a0\u201cthe prisoner\u00a0who\u00a0escaped,\" but to describe things, \"that\" and \"which\" are used, as in \u201cthe rock\u00a0that\u00a0rolled down the hill.\u201d\u00a0\n\nTraditionally, the convention has been to use \"that\u201d and \u201cwhich\" for animals, but animals advocates have long argued against this, claiming that it treats animals as if they were things rather than living beings. The headline in the Times may signal that the convention is starting to change, or it may just show uncertainty.\u00a0While the headline uses \"who,\" the first line of the Times article reads, \u201cA cow that was captured by police.\"\n\nI asked Philip Corbett, an editor for The New York Times, if the use of \u201ccow who\u201d reflected a change of policy. He told me that the Times, like other news organizations, uses \u201cwho\u201d only for animals who are treated like humans, especially animals who have names.\n\nCaught Between Who And That\n\nFor example, \u201cThe dog,\u00a0which\u00a0was lost, howled\u201d refers to the dog with \"which\" because the dog does not have a name. On the other hand, if the dog were named Adelaide, the Times would write, \u201cAdelaide,\u00a0who\u00a0was lost, howled.\u201d\n\nIn the case of the cow who escaped in New York, Corbett said that the editors might have been caught between the two examples. The cow did not have a name at the time of the escape, but when he was rescued, he was given one. Mike Stura, the founder of the animal sanctuary that took him in, named him Freddie.\n\nAmong other news organizations reporting the story, some used \u201cwho\u201d and others used \u201cthat\u201d to refer to the cow.\n\nPreference To Pets\n\nReporters are not the only ones who are undecided about how to talk about animals. A little searching on Google shows similarly mixed results. Put in \u201ccow who\u201d and you get nearly 400,000 results, compared with nearly 600,000 for \u201ccow that.\u201d If you substitute \u201cdog\u201d for \u201ccow,\u201d though, there are more than 8 million results with \"who\u201d and more than 10 million for \u201cthat,\u201d a more even split.\n\nThis could be because most of the stories written about dogs are about people\u2019s pets, who have names. According to Google search results, though, chimpanzees are referred to with \u201cwho\u201d almost twice as often as they are referred to as \u201cthat,\u201d and chimps are almost never kept as pets. This may be explained by\u00a0chimpanzees' similarity to us, and their undeniable\u00a0individuality. For gorillas and orangutans, too, \u201cwho\u201d is more common than \u201cthat.\u201d\n\nThe Gradual Word Shift\n\nGoogle Ngram is a program that charts how often different words or phrases are used from year to year. It provides another interesting perspective. Whereas there were more than 10 references to \u201ccow that\u201d for every reference to \u201ccow who\u201d in 1920, by 2000 the ratio had dropped to fewer than 5 to 1. It seems that these days, we are talking about cows as individual creatures more often, rather than as things.\n\nIt appears that the same shift is taking place with other animals, too. \"Who\u201d is apparently becoming more acceptable even for animals with whom we humans do not have personal relationships, like fish. The writer Sean Thomason recently wrote a message on Twitter about \u201cthe tuna who died to get put in a can that wound up in the back of my cabinet until past expiration.\u201d\n\nDoes the \"who\" distinction matter to anyone other than professional writers? It may be more important than it seems, as many social movements recognize that language matters because it affects how people think and act.\n\nEnglish Language Ironies\n\nFor example, the feminist movement, which fights for the rights of women, has called attention to the way English uses male language to stand for people in general. \"Mankind\" has traditionally been used to refer to all people, men and women. Language like this, some feminists have argued, has had the effect of making women invisible. Arguing for language changes has been one way that feminists have fought for women's rights.\n\nIn a similar way, the language we use to describe animals may be important to how we think about and treat them. In most legal systems today, animals are treated as property, just like tables and chairs. Animals are certainly more like humans than they are like tables and chairs, however. Our language should recognize this, even if our laws still do not.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "720L": "Opinion: There once was a cow who went for a stroll\nBy Peter Singer, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n02.17.16\n\nA herder drives his cows on a highway in the capital Naypytaw, Myanmar, Oct. 18, 2015.

The New York Times had a headline that read: \u201cCow Who Escaped New York Slaughterhouse Finds Sanctuary.\u201d The word \"who\" stuck out to me.\u00a0\n\n\"Who\u201d is usually used when we talk about people. For example: \"The boy\u00a0who\u00a0fell was crying.\u201d \"That\u201d and \u201cwhich\" are used to talk about things, as in the sentence: \"The rock that fell hit the ground.\"\u00a0\n\nWhat about animals? Traditionally, writers have used \"that\" and \"which.\" The Times headline, however, used \"who\" to talk about the runaway cow.\n\nSmall Differences In Meaning\n\nThe difference between \"the cow who escaped\" and\u00a0\u201cthe cow that escaped\u201d might seem small. Yet the language we use says a lot about how we think about animals. It gets at the question of whether we think of cows as more like people or more like things.\u00a0\n\nI spoke with Philip Corbett, an editor for The New York Times. I asked about the newspaper's rules for \"who,\" \"that\" and \"which.\" He told me that the Times only uses \u201cwho\u201d for animals who are treated like humans, such as animals with names.\n\nFor example, the sentence: \u201cThe dog,\u00a0which\u00a0was lost, howled.\u201d \"Which\" is used because the dog does not have a name. On the other hand, if the dog were named Adelaide, the Times would write, \u201cAdelaide,\u00a0who\u00a0was lost, howled.\u201d\n\nIn the case of the cow who escaped in New York, Corbett said that the editors might have been caught between the two examples. The cow did not have a name at the time of the escape. When he was rescued, however, he was given one. At the animal sanctuary, the cow was named Freddie.\n\nLet's Go To Google\n\nReporters are not the only ones who are undecided about how to talk about animals. If you search for \u201ccow who\u201d on Google, you get nearly 400,000 results. If you search for \"cow that,\" you get nearly 600,000. It seems that both \"who\" and \"that\" are used often to talk about cows.\n\nThe numbers are more even for dogs. This could be because most of the stories about dogs are about people\u2019s pets, who have names.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, people use \u201cwho\u201d to talk about chimpanzees almost twice as often as they use \"that.\u201d This might be because of chimpanzees are so smart. We think of them as being like people, of having thoughts and feelings.\n\nGoogle searches also show that the language we use to talk about animals has been changing. It is becoming more common to use \"who\" to talk about animals. In 1920, writers used the phrase \u201ccow that\u201d 10 times more often than they used \u201ccow who.\u201d In 2000, \"cow that\" was still more common, but \"who\" had become much more widely used.\n\nAnimal Talk Is Changing\n\nGradually, we seem to be talking about animals more like the way we talk about humans. This shows that thinking about animals has changed. We are starting to respect animals as living creatures, not just things.\n\nLanguage changes can also have a big effect on\u00a0how people think.\u00a0By changing how we talk about animals, we may help to change the way we treat them.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: The cow who \u2026\nBy Peter Singer, Project Syndicate\n02.17.16\n\nA herder drives his cows on a highway in the capital Naypytaw, Myanmar, Oct. 18, 2015.

The New York Times had a headline that read: \u201cCow Who Escaped New York Slaughterhouse Finds Sanctuary.\u201d Animal advocates have long struggled against the convention of reserving \u201cwho\u201d for people, and using \u201cthat\u201d or \u201cwhich\u201d for animals. Not all languages make this distinction, but in English, to refer to \u201cthe cow that escaped\u201d seems to deny the animal\u2019s agency. We would all say \u201cthe prisoner who escaped\u201d but \u201cthe rock that rolled down the hill.\u201d\n\nIt would be premature to conclude that The New York Times article indicates a shift in usage. Rather, it seems to show uncertainty, for the first line of the article refers to \u201cA cow that was captured by police.\u201d\n\nI asked Philip Corbett, the standards editor for The New York Times, if the use of \u201ccow who\u201d reflected a change of policy. He told me that the Times style manual, like that of The Associated Press, suggested using \u201cwho\u201d only for a named or personified animal. The manual gives the example \u201cThe dog, which was lost, howled\u201d and contrasts this with \u201cAdelaide, who was lost, howled.\u201d\n\nCorbett added that the editors may have been caught between the two examples. The cow, or rather steer, did not have a name at the time of the escape, but was given one \u2013 Freddie \u2013 by Mike Stura, the founder of Freddie\u2019s new home, Skylands Animal Sanctuary & Rescue.\n\nAmong media reporting the story, some used \u201cwho\u201d and others \u201cthat.\u201d A little searching on Google also shows mixed usage.

Yet, if Google is any indication, chimpanzees, who are rarely pets, are referred to as \u201cwho\u201d almost twice as often as they are referred to as \u201cthat.\u201d Their similarity to us, and their undeniable individuality, must be playing a role. For gorillas and orangutans, too, \u201cwho\u201d is more common than \u201cthat.\u201d\n\nGoogle Ngram, which charts the frequencies of words or phrases in printed sources in different years, provides another interesting perspective. Whereas there were more than 10 references to \u201ccow that\u201d for every reference to \u201ccow who\u201d in 1920, by 2000 the ratio had dropped to fewer than 5 to 1. It seems that we are personifying cows more, despite the fact that many family run dairy farms, in which the farmer knows every cow, have been replaced by corporate-run factory farms with thousands of nameless animals.\n\nMore surprising, perhaps, is that using \u201cwho\u201d apparently is becoming more acceptable even for animals who are not pets and are less likely than great apes to be thought of as individuals. It\u2019s hard to connect canned tuna with an individual fish, let alone to think of that fish as a person, but the writer Sean Thomason recently tweeted about \u201cthe tuna who died to get put in a can that wound up in the back of my cabinet until past expiration and which I just threw away.\u201d\n\nMany social movements recognize that language matters because it both reflects and reinforces injustices that need to be remedied. Feminists have provided evidence that the supposedly gender-neutral use of \u201cman\u201d and \u201che\u201d to include females has the effect of making women invisible.\n\nSeveral remedies have been proposed, the most successful of which may be the use of the plural \u201cthey\u201d in contexts like \u201cEach person should collect their belongings.\u201d Terms used for members of racial minorities, and for people with disabilities, have also been challenged, to such an extent that it can be hard to keep up with the terms preferred by those in these categories.\n\nThe use of \u201cwho\u201d for animals ranks alongside these other linguistic reforms. In most legal systems today, animals are property, just as tables and chairs are. They may be protected under animal welfare legislation, but that is not enough to prevent them being things, because antiquities and areas of natural beauty are also protected. English usage should change to make it clear that animals are fundamentally more like us than they are like tables and chairs, paintings and mountains.\n\nThe law is starting to show signs of change. In 1992, Switzerland became the first country to include a statement about protecting the dignity of animals in its constitution; Germany followed 10 years later. In 2009, the European Union amended its fundamental treaty to include a statement that because animals are sentient beings, the EU and its member states must, in formulating policies for agriculture, fisheries, research, and several other areas, \u201cpay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals.\u201d\n\nIn a language like English, which implicitly categorizes animals as things rather than persons, adopting the personal pronoun would embody the same recognition \u2013 and remind us who animals really are.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "950L": "Opinion: When a cow runs down the street, what do we call it?\nBy Peter Singer, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n02.17.16\n\nA herder drives his cows on a highway in the capital Naypytaw, Myanmar, Oct. 18, 2015.

Mike Stura, the founder of the animal sanctuary that took him in, named him Freddie.\n\nChimpanzees Are Mostly \"Who\"\n\nAmong the other newspapers reporting the story, some used \u201cwho\u201d and others used \u201cthat\u201d to refer to the cow.\u00a0\n\nReporters are not the only ones who are undecided about how to talk about animals. If you search for \u201ccow who\u201d on Google, you get nearly 400,000 results. If you search for \"cow that,\" you get nearly 600,000. It seems that writers more often use \"that\" to describe cows than \"who,\" but both words are used.\n\nThe numbers are more even for dogs. This could be because most of the stories about dogs are about people\u2019s pets, who have names.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, chimpanzees are described with \u201cwho\u201d almost twice as often as they are described with \"that.\u201d Chimps are rarely kept as pets and are probably not named more often than dogs. The difference might have to do with\u00a0chimpanzees' similarity to us, and their undeniable\u00a0individuality.\n\nThat Versus Who Through The Years\n\nGoogle Ngram is a program that charts the how often different words or phrases are used year to year. It suggests that the language we use to describe animals is gradually changing. There were more than 10 references to \u201ccow that\u201d for every reference to \u201ccow who\u201d in 1920. By 2000, there were fewer than five \"cow that\" references\" for every \"cow who.\" \"That\" was still more common, but \"who\" had become much more widely used. It seems that, these days, we are talking about cows as individual creatures more often, rather than as things.\n\nEventually, changing the way we talk about animals may help to change the way we treat them. Many social movements recognize that language matters. Language can change how people think and act.\n\nLanguage Matters\n\nThe feminist movement, for example, which fights for the rights of women, has called attention to the way the English language can make women feel invisible. When people say \"mankind\" to describe all of us, some say they leave women out. Arguing for language changes has been one way that feminists have fought for women's rights.\n\nIn a similar way, the language we use to describe animals may be important to how we think about and treat them. In most legal systems today, animals are treated as property, like tables and chairs.\u00a0\n\nAnimals are living creatures, not things. Our language should recognize this, even if our laws still do not.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "530L": "Opinion: A runaway cow has made us stop and look at words\nBy Peter Singer, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n02.17.16\n\nA herder drives his cows on a highway in the capital Naypytaw, Myanmar, Oct. 18, 2015.

Photo: AP/Russel A. Daniels\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 The elites running colleges and universities now seem to be on the same page with many Americans. Both groups are concerned about a generation of young people who are driven to achieve.\n\nThey\u2019re saying: Our cultural desire for super-accomplished, Ivy League-bound teens is doing this nation no good. Perhaps, it is damaging millions of its kids.\n\nSome students have mixed feelings about that judgment.\n\nMany praise universities who say they want to ease academic pressure on young people. Others wonder how schools can measure character and passion. Those are the qualities the schools say they're looking for.\n\nThis month, Harvard University came out with a report on the admissions process. It suggested new factors for the most selective colleges to consider when deciding which students to let in.\n\nRanking Quality Over Quantity\n\nLook for \u201ccaring\u201d and \u201cethical.\u201d Rank the quality of their achievements over the quantity of achievements. Enroll young people focused on pursuing a genuine passion rather than just those determined to assemble a list of extra-curricular activities.\n\nThe report also advised schools to consider another group: less academically accomplished high-schoolers who have spent time caring for a sick relative or juggled jobs to help their families. \u00a0\n\nMore than 50 institutions and groups say they support the report. They include\u00a0U.S. colleges and universities, prep schools, mental health groups and research groups.\u00a0\n\nThe report also left some people unconvinced.\u00a0\n\nProblem Will Persist, Critic Says\n\nSara Harberson is a critic of the admissions process and founder of a website called \"Admissions Revolution.\"\u00a0\n\n\u201cGiving students a high-minded outline for becoming better applicants doesn\u2019t change the underlying problem,\u201d she wrote. Harberson believes schools will still unfairly favor some students over others. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nTo some top high school seniors, however, this gentler approach sounds good.\u00a0In fact, they say some admissions counselors have already urged them to \"be themselves.\" \u00a0\n\nStill it\u2019s hard to trust those counselors. What if they're wrong?\n\nSome Students Remain Skeptical\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really know what\u2019s in their heads,\u201d Suruchi Ramanujan\u00a0said about the people who decide who gets in and who doesn\u2019t. Ramanujan\u00a0is a senior at Blue Valley Northwest High School in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d said classmate Claudia Chen. \u201c\u2018Be yourself\u2019 \u2014 as long as your self likes this and this and this and this.\u201d\n\nThey laugh about it now. They feel lucky. Ramanujan has been accepted to Harvard and Chen to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), both elite schools. They even made it in while being themselves, mostly.\n\nThey both, however, added AP history to their class schedules on top of all their high-level math and science. And they didn't do it because they enjoy college-level history.\n\nGoals Include Diversity\n\nIn recent years, college admissions directors have modified the type of student they're looking for, increasingly seeking more \"holistic\" evaluations of applicants. This means they're looking at the whole person, not just grades and after-school activities. This has been especially true at the most pricy and ultraselective universities. \u00a0\n\nAt hundreds of schools, it's now optional to submit college entrance exam scores. Many now require applicants to write personal essays. The essays can convey information a grade point average cannot.\n\nThe Harvard report sets forth a number of goals.\n\nOne is to reduce stresses on teenagers who tackle more advanced courses than they need. Another is to diversify the student body at prestigious colleges. A third is to provide opportunities and hope to a larger population of young scholars who may have lower test scores. \u00a0\n\nCaring Of Others Stressed\n\nAnd finally, the report says admission standards should aim to help young people become more \u201ccaring of others.\u201d\n\nSearching for more balanced applicants isn\u2019t an entirely new mission among elite schools. Yet Harvard\u2019s report suggests something is different. Stuart Schmill is dean of admissions at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He says the report shows that colleges are serious about accepting other types of students. Schmill calls these students \"the best of the rest.\" \u00a0\u00a0\n\nWait, what happened to the old rules? Most of us are told that high grades and school involvement are critical to youth success and a promising career.\n\nColleges and educators bear some responsibility for this dysfunctional system we\u2019ve got, said Michael Beseda. He is vice president for enrollment at Oregon's Willamette University.\n\nElite Schools Create Inequality\n\nThe dysfunction he's talking about has allowed kids from wealthier families to attend prestigious schools in greater numbers. The gap between the haves and have-nots has not narrowed, Beseda said. In fact, he said, \"higher education has become an engine of greater inequality.\" \u00a0\u00a0\n\nSuper-selective schools that enroll only a small number of applicants have come under the harshest criticism. They are judged for steering the luckiest youths into the best-paying jobs. Many feel they have pushed achievement over contentment and kindness.\n\nDavid Cantwell is a counselor at Kansas City\u2019s public Lincoln College Preparatory Academy. He said Harvard's report and the high number of endorsements it has received are telling. It reflects worries about a generation that elite schools helped create.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve discovered a void in the quality of the population they\u2019ve attracted,\" he said, \"being so test-centered.\"\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: Time to ease pressure on overachievers for college admissions?\nBy Rick Montgomery and Joe Robertson, Kansas City Star\n02.16.16\n\nWilson Liang, 17, poses for a portrait at Galileo High School in San Francisco, California, Dec. 18, 2009.

Daniels\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 The elites of higher education now seem on the same page with a broad swath of Americans concerned about a generation driven to achieve.\n\nThey\u2019re saying: Our cultural quest to construct super-accomplished, resume-armed, Ivy League-bound teens is doing this nation no good and perhaps damaging millions of its kids.\n\nSome students have mixed feelings about that assessment.\n\nMany are lauding academia\u2019s stated wish to ease pressure on youngsters who feel they must earn near-perfect test scores to attain a bright future. Others wonder how colleges can measure the attributes they say they\u2019re seeking \u2014 \u201ccharacter,\u201d \u201cpassion\u201d and such.\n\nFrom Harvard University came a report this month that framed new criteria for the most selective colleges to consider when weighing the types of applicants they should select.\n\nLook for \u201ccaring\u201d and \u201cethical.\u201d Rank the quality of their achievements over the quantity. Enroll young people focused on pursuing a genuine passion rather than just those determined to compile a list of far-flung activities.\n\nConsider less decorated high-schoolers who have committed time to a sick relative or juggled jobs to help their families. Fixate less on those spending their formative years consumed by a perceived need to massage college entrance test marks or amass extracurricular endeavors, the report advised.\n\nThe findings and recommendations of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, titled \u201cTurning the Tide,\u201d drew the endorsement of more than 50 U.S. colleges and universities, prep schools, mental health groups and think tanks.\n\nIt also stirred skepticism among critics of the college admissions process.\n\n\u201cGiving students a high-minded outline for becoming better applicants doesn\u2019t change the underlying problem,\u201d wrote Sara Harberson, founder of a website called Admissions Revolution, in The Huffington Post. \u201cInstitutional biases continue to corrupt a process that should be pure and noble.\u201d\n\nAnd what\u2019s the thinking of local students indoctrinated in a culture of Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses, test preparation and ferocious competition to be noticed by the prestige institutions?\n\nThis gentler, passion-fed approach sounds good, say top high school seniors who have been through the enrollment wringer.\n\nIn fact, admissions counselors they visited at plum universities along the way had already urged them to \u201cbe yourself, pursue your passion, don\u2019t just pad your resumes.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to trust them. In this kind of race, it\u2019s hard to ease off the gas pedal.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really know what\u2019s in their heads,\u201d Blue Valley Northwest High School senior Suruchi Ramanujan said about those deciders of who gets in and who doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d said classmate Claudia Chen. \u201c\u2018Be yourself\u2019 \u2014 as long as your self likes this and this and this and this.\u201d\n\nThey laugh about it now.

Many now require that applicants write personal essays to reveal what their GPAs do not.\n\nThe Harvard report sets forth many objectives.\n\nOne is to reduce stresses on teenagers who plow into more advanced courses than they need. Another is to diversify the student body at prestigious colleges. A third is to provide opportunities and hope to young scholars who might not apply to such places because their high school scores aren\u2019t stellar.\n\nAnd finally, admissions criteria should aim to help young people become more generous and \u201ccaring of others.\u201d\n\nHigh school students \u201coften perceive colleges as simply valuing their achievements, not their responsibility for others and their communities,\u201d said the report co-authored by the education school\u2019s Richard Weissbourd and Lloyd Thacker, executive director of the Education Conservancy. \u201cWhile some colleges have diligently sought to convey to applicants the importance of concern for others and the common good, many other colleges have not.\u201d\n\nSearching for more balanced and less frazzled college prospects isn\u2019t an entirely new mission among elite schools. But Harvard\u2019s critique, coming during the season when applications spike, signals that admissions offices are serious about leveling the playing field between manic achievers and the best of the rest, said Stuart Schmill, dean of admissions at MIT.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s become a bit of a mismatch between what we really expect out of students and what they think we expect,\u201d said Schmill, one of the report\u2019s dozens of endorsers.\n\n\u201cThe academics still need to be strong,\u201d he said, but many high school students might boost their chances by drilling into a favorite field of study rather than spreading themselves thin with a multitude of honors courses and activities.\n\nBut wait \u2014 weren\u2019t we all told something different?\n\nWhat happened to the litany about top grades, school involvement and nose-to-the-homework being so critical to youth success and a prosperous career?\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re asking if colleges and educators bear some responsibility for this dysfunctional system we\u2019ve got, oh yeah, I completely agree,\u201d said Michael Beseda, vice president for enrollment at Willamette University, another endorser of the Harvard report.\n\nThe dysfunction to which he refers has allowed privileged kids with the best resources to pack the halls of exclusive institutions. Rather than narrowing the gap between the haves and have-nots, \u201chigher education has become an engine of greater inequality,\u201d Beseda said.\n\nSuper-selective schools have come under the harshest criticism \u2014 not only for steering the luckiest youths into the best-paying jobs, but also for promoting achievement and hoop-jumping over contentment and kindness.\n\nThe 2014 book \u201cExcellent Sheep,\u201d by former Yale University professor William Deresiewicz, skewered the Ivy League with accounts of students battling depression, eating disorders and thoughts of suicide.\n\nDavid Cantwell, a counselor at Kansas City\u2019s public Lincoln College Preparatory Academy, said Harvard\u2019s assessment and the tide of endorsements reflect worries about a generation that elite schools helped create.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve discovered a void in the quality of the population they\u2019ve attracted, being so test-centered,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat Students See\n\nSome students do see wisdom in the idea.\n\nBy casting a wider net to snare the right freshmen, prestigious schools might lift those who don\u2019t have all of the resources for extra tutoring and test-prep books, some said.\n\nDavid Lietjauw, a senior at Olathe North High School, knows the strain of limited family resources as he tries to take his engineering dreams to Rice University, or Washington University, or maybe Princeton.\n\n\u201cYou hear about how you can pay someone to write your essays or get them edited,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd when he worried about his prep for the ACT, his mother suggested they could hire a tutor.\n\n\u201cBut we looked on the Internet and, yeah, we couldn\u2019t afford a tutor.\u201d\n\nSo he loaded up with library books. And he spent much of his family\u2019s vacation last year slipping into hotel lobbies with his laptop, writing and polishing essay after essay.\n\n\u201cThat some may have the money\u201d for editors and tutors \u201cis creating more of a divide,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s rigged.\u201d\n\nEven as it goes now, at universities where the successful enrollments can be as low as 5 percent of all applicants, the odds seem as much outlandish as arbitrary, students said.\n\nRockhurst High School senior Daniel Henry considers himself fortunate, having been accepted at Stanford University. But he thinks of a close friend who missed out on getting into his choice university.\n\n\u201cHe is the hardest worker, the most selfless person you\u2019d ever meet,\u201d Henry said, but when it came to his college application, \u201cI think he was too humble.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d Henry said. \u201cAdmission is a crapshoot. You\u2019re competing with an immense group of people.\u201d\n\nTalking about the laurels and services they achieved in high school is embarrassing to most of these students, who really want to retain their humility. So here are, without attaching them to specific students, some of the many items that made their various applications, many of these feats duplicated among the students:\n\nStudent council president. Founder of an anti-drug campaign. Debate club. Forensics. Young business entrepreneur. Founder of computer code writing class for girls. Tutor of classmates in 3-D printer programming. Volleyball. Baseball. Football. Track. Piano. Choir. Congressional Award medalist. Robotics team. Founder of tennis tournament for cystic fibrosis. Perfect ACT score. President of the Math and Science Honors Society. Science Olympiad. Newspaper editor.\n\nThis is only a partial list.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only in four,\u201d Olathe North senior Alisha Gupta said, somewhat sheepishly, of her participation in organizations. \u201cI know it sounds like a lot,\u201d she added for those who don\u2019t know just how intense this college game can be. She is aiming her political science and law school aspirations at the University of Chicago, Brown University and Georgetown.\n\n\u201cYou struggle with it,\u201d she said. \u201cAm I doing this (club or service) because it will look good on my transcript? Or am I trying to do something that I like?\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to be the person who does everything, but it\u2019s impossible,\u201d said Jared Gillen, a senior at the Barstow School. He is headed for Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania.\n\nBut \u201cyou wonder,\u201d he said. \u201cDid I do enough? Regret creeps into your mind. I don\u2019t know if it is possible to ease up.\u201d\n\nThe difference in getting a college choice and coming up short \u201cis so subtle,\u201d Barstow senior Shanley Lenart said. \u201cWhat if you got one more point on the ACT? What if you got one more A?\u201d\n\nLenart has been accepted at Carnegie Mellon University as a chemical engineering student, but she had talked herself through the real possibility that her top choices might not happen.\n\n\u201cI had to lose some of the high school experience,\u201d she said, meaning the social gatherings missed, the Saturday nights given to studies. \u201cOne of the scary parts are the questions: Will the work pay off?\u201d\n\nShe had to banish the thought that if she missed out on Carnegie Mellon, how would she \u201cprove what a good student I am? I had to convince myself that the name of the school didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nChen at Blue Valley Northwest, only half as a joke, had put a photo of an MIT rejection letter as her phone background, to prepare for the worst.\n\nThat anxiety is not going to go away, regardless of whatever changes elite universities make to their admission process, said Olathe North senior Disha Dasgupta.\n\nManaging the kind of stress she endured in gaining acceptance to the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena will still weigh on students.\n\n\u201cThe intensity is as much as you make it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can keep putting things on your transcript, but you can never predict what colleges want.\u201d\n\nA Complex Problem\n\nLast week, about 150 people crowded into an auditorium at the Kansas City Public Library for a screening of \u201cRace to Nowhere,\u201d a documentary about American pupils succumbing to the pressures of academic overachievement.\n\nSome educators blamed parents for expecting too much and overloading their kids\u2019 schedules.\n\nSome parents blamed educators for assigning homework that kept students up past midnight.\n\nSome kids blamed high schools for standardized testing that required memorization they couldn\u2019t retain.\n\nA complex problem for sure, it all leads to students cheating on their assignments, illegally popping attention deficit disorder pills, even cutting themselves, noted the 2010 film produced by Vicki Abeles, an advocate of education reform.\n\nAt a panel discussion after the show, moderator R. Crosby Kemper III, the library system\u2019s executive director, questioned whether society is becoming too \u201canti-homework\u201d and sympathetic of youngsters who resist rigorous study. Christine Taylor-Butler, an author of children\u2019s books and former interviewer for MIT admissions, urged more college preparation, especially in urban schools serving low-income students.\n\nFor those teens, a university scholarship might be a ticket out of poverty.\n\nSeveral of the panelists observed that most of the families featured in the documentary appeared to be well-to-do \u2014 able to afford tutoring, test preparation seminars and music lessons. The film made little mention of the spiraling cost of higher education adding to stress levels.\n\nAt Lincoln Prep, senior Phillip Nguyen encounters that constant barrier of affordability just to get into the college preparation game.\n\n\u201cThere are application fees, standardized test fees,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to pay to send ACT scores to a lot of schools. It costs just to be considered.\u201d\n\nHe works part time as a barista, and he\u2019s making his bid for Ivy League schools from Kansas City\u2019s Northeast neighborhood. Not a privileged world.\n\nWhether or not more colleges start practicing what Harvard is now preaching, some local students wonder if anything will make their paths less strenuous.\n\n\u201cThe high reputations of these schools,\u201d said Lincoln schoolmate Diana Gonzalez, are \u201cenough to make you freak out. \u2026\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t have everything they\u2019re asking for, I hope the other things about me come into play.\u201d\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "580L": "Opinion: Should colleges care about how kind you are?\nBy Kansas City Star, adapted by Newsela staff\n02.16.16\n\nWilson Liang, 17, poses for a portrait at Galileo High School in San Francisco, California, Dec. 18, 2009.

It can all be very stressful.\n\nThere is a new report from Harvard University. It is one of the best universities in the world. The report says Harvard is concerned about teenagers. It says teenagers may be too stressed about getting good grades. \u00a0\n\nThe report says besides good grades, other things matter. It says it is important for students to be good people. The report says being a good person should help students get into a top university.\n\nPeople Disagree About Report\n\nStudents have mixed feelings about the report.\n\nSome say they are too stressed about grades. They agree that being a good person should be important. Others wonder how universities can tell if someone is a good person. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nMore than 50 universities in the United States praised the report. They agreed with what it said. Many other groups praised it, too.\u00a0\n\nOther people were not convinced.\n\nUniversities Already Changing\n\nSara Harberson has a website. It helps students get into universities. Sometimes the students get in and sometimes they do not.\u00a0\n\nHarberson does not like the way universities choose students. Asking students to be good people will not solve the problem, she says. Universities will always want some students more than others.\n\nSome high school students feel differently. They want universities to look at other things besides grades. They want universities to see that they are good people.\n\nIn the past few years, universities have begun to change.\u00a0\n\nHundreds of schools no longer ask for test scores. Instead, students have to write something about themselves.

It urged them to fixate less on youngsters consumed with college entrance exams or extracurricular activities. \u00a0\n\nThe findings and recommendations, titled \"Turning the Tide,\" came from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. It drew the endorsement of more than 50 U.S. colleges and universities, prep schools, mental health groups and think tanks.\n\nIt also stirred skepticism among critics of the college admissions process.\n\n\u201cGiving students a high-minded outline for becoming better applicants doesn\u2019t change the underlying problem,\u201d wrote Sara Harberson. She is founder of a website called Admissions Revolution, in The Huffington Post. \u201cInstitutional biases continue to corrupt a process that should be pure and noble.\u201d\n\n\"Don't Just Pad Your Resumes\"\n\nTo some top high school seniors, however, this gentler, passion-fed approach sounds good.\u00a0In fact, admissions counselors they visited at plum universities along the way had already urged them to \u201cbe yourself, pursue your passion, don\u2019t just pad your resumes.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to trust them. In this kind of race, it\u2019s hard to ease off the gas pedal.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really know what\u2019s in their heads,\u201d Suruchi Ramanujan\u00a0said about those deciders of who gets in and who doesn\u2019t. \u00a0Ramanuian is a senior at Blue Valley Northwest High School in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d said classmate Claudia Chen. \u201c\u2018Be yourself\u2019 \u2014 as long as your self likes this and this and this and this.\u201d\n\nThey laugh about it now.

Their enthusiasm for history was, well, scant.\n\nCollege admissions directors nationwide have joined a growing chorus in recent years. They are calling for \u201cholistic\u201d evaluations of applicants, especially at the most pricey and ultraselective schools.\n\nHundreds of colleges have made optional the submission of ACT and SAT college entrance exam scores. Many now require that applicants write personal essays to reveal what their GPAs do not.\n\nThe Harvard report sets forth many objectives.\n\nOne is to reduce stresses on teenagers who plow into more advanced courses than they need. Another is to diversify the student body at prestigious colleges. A third is to provide opportunities and hope to young scholars who might not apply to such places because their high school scores aren\u2019t stellar.\n\nRethinking The Old Rules\n\nAnd finally, admission standards should aim to help young people become more generous and \u201ccaring of others.\u201d\n\nSearching for more balanced and less-frazzled college prospects isn\u2019t an entirely new mission among elite schools. Harvard's report, which comes\u00a0during the season when applications spike, may be a signal of sorts. It suggests that\u00a0admissions officers are serious about leveling the playing field between manic achievers and the best of the rest, said Stuart Schmill, dean of admissions at MIT.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s become a bit of a mismatch between what we really expect out of students and what they think we expect,\u201d said Schmill, one of the report\u2019s dozens of endorsers.\n\n\u201cThe academics still need to be strong,\u201d he said. However, many high school students might boost their chances by drilling into a favorite field of study rather than spreading themselves thin with a multitude of honors courses and activities.\n\nBut wait \u2014 weren\u2019t we all told something different?\n\nWhat happened to the old rules about top grades, school involvement and homework being so critical to youth success and a prosperous career?\n\nHave Colleges Fueled Inequality?\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re asking if colleges and educators bear some responsibility for this dysfunctional system we\u2019ve got, oh yeah, I completely agree,\u201d said Michael Beseda. He's vice president for enrollment at Oregon's Willamette University, another endorser of the Harvard report.\n\nThe dysfunction to which he refers has allowed privileged kids with the best resources to pack the halls of exclusive institutions. Rather than narrowing the gap between the haves and have-nots, \u201chigher education has become an engine of greater inequality,\u201d Beseda said. \u00a0\n\nSuper-selective schools have come under the harshest criticism.

Photo: AP/Russel A. Daniels\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 Many high school students want to get into a top college. To do this, they must have good grades and high test scores. All this can be very stressful.\n\nThere is a new report from Harvard University, one of the top schools in the world. The report says the university is concerned that the younger generation may be too worried about getting good grades. \u00a0\n\nStudents have mixed feelings about the report.\n\nSome praise universities who say they want to ease pressure on young people. Others wonder how the schools can measure the qualities that schools say they are looking for. One of those qualities is character.\u00a0\n\nThe report says top colleges should look for \"caring\" students. Students should also know the difference between right and wrong. It says the quality of students' achievements is more important than the number of achievements they have.\u00a0\n\nStudents Who Are Good People\n\nThe report also advises schools to consider another group of students. These are students who may not have top grades, but they are good people. Perhaps they have helped a sick relative or worked several jobs to help their families. \u00a0\n\nMore than 50 U.S. colleges and universities praised the report and agreed with what it said. Many other groups praised it too.\u00a0\n\nSome people, however, were not convinced.\n\nSara Harberson created a website called \"Admissions Revolution.\" She does not like the way colleges and universities accept and turn away students.\u00a0\n\nNo Real Solution, Critic Says\n\nGiving students an outline for becoming better applicants doesn\u2019t fix the bigger problem, she said.\u00a0Harberson does not think the answer is asking students to be nicer or more caring. She thinks colleges will still be unfair about who they let in. She says they will always favor certain students over others. \u00a0\n\nSome seniors in their last year of high school feel differently. They think this gentler approach sounds good.\u00a0In fact, they say some admissions counselors have already urged them to \"be themselves.\" \u00a0\n\nStill it is hard to trust those counselors. What if they're wrong?\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really know what\u2019s in their heads,\u201d Suruchi Ramanujan\u00a0said about the people who decide who gets in and who doesn\u2019t. Ramanujan lives in Kansas and is in his last year of high school.\n\nMore To It Than Grades\n\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d said classmate Claudia Chen. \u201c\u2018Be yourself\u2019 \u2014 as long as your self likes this and this and this and this.\u201d\n\nThey laugh about it now and feel lucky. Ramanujan has been accepted to Harvard and Chen to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), both elite schools.\u00a0\n\nIn the past few years, colleges have changed the type of student they're looking for. They are no longer just looking at grades and after-school activities. Now, schools are taking a more \"holistic\" approach. This means they're looking at the whole person. This has been especially true at some of the top universities. \u00a0\n\nAt hundreds of schools, students no longer have to provide test scores. Instead, they have to write something about themselves. This can provide information that a grade or a test score cannot. \u00a0\n\nA Way To Give Teens Hope\n\nThe Harvard report has several goals.\n\nOne is to lower stress among teenagers who are taking hard classes. Another is to diversify the student population at elite universities. Schools would diversify by inviting all different types of young people to sign up. A third is to provide hope to high school students who may have lower test scores. \u00a0\n\nSearching for more balanced students isn't entirely new for elite schools. Still, Harvard\u2019s report suggests something has changed.\u00a0\n\nStuart Schmill works at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He helps decide which high school students can attend the school.\u00a0Schmill says the report shows that admissions offices are serious about opening up to other types of students.\u00a0\n\nHe\u00a0calls these students \"the best of the rest.\"\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In"}, {"930L": "PRO/CON: Should we know everything about a candidate's health?\nBy Tribune News Service, adapted by Newsela staff\n02.12.16\n\nAt 74 years old, Bernie Sanders (left) is the oldest candidate in the presidential race, which makes some Americans worried about his health.

Staab/CBS via AP\nPRO: Age and health are important issues in this election\nTwo senior citizens are competing for the Democratic nomination for president. And a 69-year-old man with weight problems is leading the Republican field. One can only wonder why the nation\u2019s reporters haven\u2019t zeroed in on the health of presidential candidates.\n\nSurely a candidate\u2019s physical and mental fitness for presidency should be a pressing concern this fall. It is particularly true in this era of global turmoil.\n\nThe Democrats and Republicans are the main political parties in America. They will nominate candidates who will compete against each other in the general election in November.\n\nWe Should See Complete Medical Reports\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will be 75 in November. He was born on Sept. 8, 1941 \u2014 just months before Japan\u2019s attack on Pearl Harbor that led to America entering World War II.\n\nSanders had a minor operation this past November, but other than that, he seems to be healthy. Still, a complete medical report would make voters feel more reassured.\n\nHis main opponent, Hillary Clinton, has a recent history of falling down on the job \u2014 literally. She has fainted four times since 1998. She fainted twice while serving as a U.S. senator from New York and two more times as secretary of state.\n\nThe last episode reportedly occurred at the Clinton mansion just off Washington\u2019s Embassy Row in December 2012. It was the most serious. She hit her head, leading to a concussion, a minor brain injury. She returned to work the next month.\n\nThe personal doctors of Clinton and Sanders released one-page letters in late January. They vouched for their patients\u2019 good health, but Hillary\u2019s doctor did not mention her fainting spells.\n\nMaking A Truly Informed Decision\n\nOn the Republican side, Donald Trump appears reasonably healthy and is enjoying his campaign. But he\u2019s older than Clinton and has struggled off-and-on with his weight.\n\nOther top Republican candidates are much younger than Sanders, Clinton and Trump. However, they may have medical problems that are not obvious.\n\nAs of now, voters cannot look at the complete medical reports of Republican candidates like Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida. And so, people will vote without important information that would help them make a truly informed decision.\n\nConsider the case of President Woodrow Wilson. He led the nation through World War I, which ended in 1918. Then he suffered a stroke at perhaps the most important moment of his presidency. A stroke is when a blood vessel in the brain either is blocked or bursts.\n\nWilson believed that a world organization should be created to try to solve disputes between nations. He successfully persuaded the major European powers to support his vision for this organization, the League of Nations. He included it in the Versailles Treaty, which formally ended the war. Returning home he was unable to convince senators, who did not approve of the treaty.\n\nWilson decided to ignore the Senate. Against the advice of his doctor, he took his case for the treaty to the American people with a cross-country train tour. Wilson began the tour \u2014 8,000 miles in 22 days \u2014 on Sept. 3, 1919. The grueling schedule cost the president his health and ultimately his life.\n\nWilson Suffered A Stroke In Office\n\nDuring the tour, Wilson began to suffer headaches and in late September collapsed from exhaustion in Pueblo, Colorado. He was rushed back to Washington, D.C., but suffered a near-fatal stroke on Oct. 2 that left his left side paralyzed and harmed his vision.\n\nHis wife, Edith, called his doctor, and the two decided to keep his condition from the American people. For the last 17 months of Wilson\u2019s presidency, all communications went through his wife. She entered his sick room and came out with instructions about running the government.\n\nWithout Wilson, America rejected joining the League of Nations. Many historians believe this set the stage for World War II.\u00a0\n\nWilson\u2019s illness shows why it\u2019s so important that American voters have complete and open access to all the candidates\u2019 medical records.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Independent journalist Whitt Flora is a former chief congressional correspondent for Aviation & Space Technology Magazine and a former White House correspondent for the Columbus Dispatch.

Still, they shouldn\u2019t be judged on their age or health.\n\nHistorically, people have assumed that a candidate's medical history and age should be considered. Such thinking represents an outdated view of health and medicine.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s political team lost no chance to talk about Senator John McCain\u2019s age as a factor in the 2008 presidential race. McCain, the Republican candidate, was 72 years old.\n\nThe Candidates Can Do The Job Now\n\nClinton, a Democrat, is 68 and Trump, a Republican, is 69. The winner of the Republican and Democratic primary elections will compete in the general election in November. Clinton fell and hit her head while secretary of state, and Trump has spoken about his poor eating habits. Both struggle with their weight.\n\nIn the case of Trump and Clinton, their age alone puts them at higher risk for medical problems.\n\nYet older age, and even a history of medical problems, shouldn\u2019t be a big factor. If these health problems already made it hard for them to do their job, that might be another story.\n\nIllness puts a person at higher risk for future problems. The opposite isn\u2019t necessarily true. Just because someone is at a higher risk for a bad medical problem doesn\u2019t mean he or she cannot do the job now.\n\nMedical discoveries and healthier living are not just making people live longer. They are also remaining stronger and active far longer.\n\nToday, we have drugs and medical devices, so health conditions like heart disease don't affect people as much as they used to. Better tests and frequent visits to the doctor mean that diseases, like cancer, are detected early. When they are caught early, they often can be cured.\n\nRecent presidents have had medical problems. They haven't really affected their job as president.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan had a form of colon cancer while in office. A section of his colon, which is part of the digestive system, was removed. President George H.W. Bush had heart problems. President Bill Clinton underwent open heart surgery for treatment of advanced heart disease less than four years after leaving office.\n\nWeighing Future Health Risks\n\nA person can have a medical problem that creates a possible future risk. It is different from one that affects a person\u2019s current mental and physical fitness.\n\nSome things are known about the health of all the leading candidates for president. Some have conditions that could increase their risk for a future health problem. But none have a medical problem that should harm their ability to be president or slow them down.\n\nThe kinds of things that put people at risk in the past are being solved by technology. In a study of men born before 1913, high blood pressure was the top risk factor for death from stroke. A stroke is a blocked or burst blood vessel in the brain.\n\nToday, there are highly effective drugs to treat high blood pressure. Now, smoking is becoming the leading cause of death. Cancer deaths are falling as more cancers are caught early. Also, people are being cured by drugs that make them less likely to get cancer or health problems.\n\nMany people have struggled through a medical problem. Almost all of us eventually will. Those who have know what a struggle illness can be. They also know, as well, that it can make people stronger.\n\nAt one time, a health condition meant that a person should not be president. Now, struggling through a health problem can be a reason to get people's votes.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Scott Gottlieb is a practicing physician who has served in various capacities at the Food and Drug Administration, including senior adviser for medical technology.

Such thinking represents an outdated view of health and the practice of medicine.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s political team lost no chance to exploit Senator John McCain\u2019s age as a factor in the 2008 presidential race.

If these problems already limit their ability to function, that might be another story.\n\nIllness and chronic ailments put a person at higher risk for future problems, but the opposite isn\u2019t necessarily true. Just because someone is at a higher risk for a bad medical problem doesn\u2019t mean he or she cannot serve as president now.\n\nMedical advances and healthier living are pushing the boundaries not only of life expectancy. People are also remaining more vital and active far longer into their later years.\n\nToday, the impact of health conditions like heart disease is made far more manageable by modern drugs and medical devices. Better tests and close medical supervision, of the sort the president receives, have made early detection a key factor in curing diseases like cancer.\n\nReagan, Bush And Clinton\n\nRecent presidents have faced medical problems with little impact on their duties to the office.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan was diagnosed with a form of early colon cancer while in office, and had surgery to remove part of his colon. President George H.W. Bush had heart problems and an overactive thyroid gland. President Bill Clinton underwent quadruple bypass surgery for treatment of advanced heart disease less than four years after leaving office.\n\nModern medicine makes things possible that never were before. We know the difference between a medical history that creates a possible future risk and one that impairs a person\u2019s current mental and physical fitness.\n\nBased on what\u2019s known so far about the health of all the leading candidates for the presidency, some have conditions that could increase their risk for a future health problem. But none have a problem that should impair their fitness for the office or slow them down.\n\nThe kinds of things that put people at risk in the past are being solved by technology. In a study of men born before 1913, the top risk factor for death from stroke, a burst or blocked blood vessel in the brain, was high blood pressure.\n\nToday, high blood pressure is treated by highly effective drugs, and smoking is becoming the leading factor of death. Cancer deaths are falling as more cancers are caught early. Also, people are being cured by drugs that put them at far less risk for future cancers and health problems.\n\nMany people have struggled through a medical hardship. Almost all of us eventually will. Those who have, bear witness to the hardships of illness as well as the humility and strength that comes with persevering.\n\nThat struggle can be as much of a qualification for major office as a health condition was, at one time, an exclusion.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Scott Gottlieb is a practicing physician who has served in various capacities at the Food and Drug Administration, including senior adviser for medical technology.

She returned to work the next month.\n\nThe personal physicians of Clinton and Sanders released one-page letters in late January attesting to their patients\u2019 good health, but Hillary\u2019s made no mention of her fainting spells.\n\nOn the GOP side, Donald Trump appears reasonably healthy and is enjoying himself on the stump, but he\u2019s older than Clinton and has waged an off-and-on battle with his weight.\n\nOther top Republican candidates, while considerably younger than Sanders, Clinton and Trump, may have lurking medical ailments not apparent to the naked eye.\n\nWithout a chance to peruse the complete and certified medical reports of GOP front-runners like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, voters will go to the polls without a body of vital knowledge that would help them make a truly informed decision.\n\nConsider the case of Woodrow Wilson, who led the nation through World War I only to suffer an incapacitating stroke at, perhaps, the most crucial moment of his presidency.\n\nWilson successfully persuaded the major European powers to back his vision for a League of Nations by including it in the Versailles Treaty. Returning home he was unable to convince conservative senators, who blocked ratification of the treaty.\n\nA fervent believer in a global body to mediate and solve disputes between nations, Wilson decided to bypass the Senate and \u2014 against the advice of his personal physician \u2014 take his case to the people with a cross-country train tour.\n\nWilson began the tour \u2014 8,000 miles in 22 days \u2014 on Sept. 3, 1919. The grueling schedule cost the president his health and ultimately his life.\n\nDuring the tour, Wilson began to suffer pervasive headaches and in late September collapsed from exhaustion in Pueblo, Colo. He was rushed back to the nation\u2019s capital, but suffered a near-fatal stroke on Oct. 2 that left his left side paralyzed and impaired his vision.\n\nHis wife, Edith, summoned his personal physician and the two decided to keep his condition from the American people.\n\nFor the last 17 months of Wilson\u2019s presidency all communications went through his wife, who entered his sick room and came out with verbal instructions or written orders with an often illegible scrawl on the line awaiting his signature.\n\nWithout Wilson\u2019s driving force, America rejected joining the League of Nations, an action which many historians believe set the stage for World War II.\n\nWilson\u2019s illness shows why it\u2019s so crucial that American voters have complete and unfiltered access to candidates\u2019 medical records before they go the polls.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Independent journalist Whitt Flora is a former chief congressional correspondent for Aviation & Space Technology Magazine and a former White House correspondent for the Columbus Dispatch.

But their fitness for office shouldn\u2019t inevitably follow from their age or accumulated health problems.\n\nHistorically, there\u2019s been a political presumption that clinical history and older age are legitimate factors in assessing fitness for office. Such thinking represents an outdated view of health and the practice of medicine.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s political team lost no chance to exploit Sen. John McCain\u2019s age as a factor in the 2008 presidential race. McCain would have been 72 when he was first sworn into the office.\n\nClinton is 68 and Trump is 69. Clinton suffered a well-publicized head injury while secretary of state. Trump has noted his poor eating habits. Each has had reference made to their struggles with weight.\n\nIt\u2019s true that, in the case of Trump and Clinton, their age alone puts them at higher risk for a litany of medical conditions.\n\nYet older age, and even a history of medical insults, shouldn\u2019t be a big factor in how voters judge candidates for the presidency so long as these influences aren\u2019t already revealed to limit their current capacities.\n\nEpisodes of illness and chronic ailments put a person at higher risk for future problems. But the inverse isn\u2019t unavoidably true. Just because someone is at an elevated risk for a bad medical outcome doesn\u2019t impact his or her present fitness.\n\nMedical advances and healthier living are pushing out the boundaries not only of life expectancy, but also of the ability of people to remain more vital and active far longer into their later years.\n\nToday, the impact of health conditions like heart disease is made far more manageable by modern drugs and medical devices. Better diagnostic tests and close medical supervision, of the sort afforded to our president, have made early diagnosis a key factor in curing diseases like cancer.\n\nRecent presidents have faced medical problems with little impact on their duties to the office.\n\nRonald Reagan was diagnosed with a form of early colon cancer while in office, requiring removal of part of his colon. President George H.W. Bush had atrial fibrillation and hyperthyroidism. Bill Clinton underwent quadruple bypass surgery for treatment of advanced heart disease less than four years after leaving office.\n\nThe benefits offered by modern medicine affords us the opportunity to draw a sharp distinction between a medical history that creates clinical risk and one that impairs a person\u2019s current mental and physical fitness.\n\nBased on what\u2019s known so far about the health profile of all the leading candidates for the presidency, some have conditions that could increase their risk for a future health problem. But none have a medical profile that should impair their fitness for the office or slow them down.\n\nThe kinds of things that put people at risk in the past are being solved by technology. In a study of men born before 1913, the top risk factor for death from stroke was high blood pressure.\n\nToday, with hypertension better treated by an armamentarium of highly effective drugs, smoking is becoming the leading factor. Cancer deaths are falling as more people are diagnosed earlier and cured by targeted drugs that put them at far less risk for future cancers and health problems.\n\nMany people have struggled through a medical hardship. Almost all of us eventually will. Those who have, bear witness to the indecencies of illness as well as the humility and strength that comes with persevering.\n\nThat struggle can be as much of a qualification for major office as a health condition was, at one time, an exclusion.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Scott Gottlieb is a practicing physician who has served in various capacities at the Food and Drug Administration, including senior adviser for medical technology.

A 69-year-old man with weight problems is leading the Republicans. One can only wonder why reporters haven\u2019t zeroed in on the health of presidential candidates.\n\nThis year, there will be two sets of primary elections for president. One is for the Democrats and the other is for the Republicans. They are the main political groups in America. The winner from each political party will run against the other in the general election. It will take place in November 2016.\n\nSurely a candidate\u2019s health should be important to voters.\n\nHealthy Enough For President?\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is a Democrat. He will be 75 during the general election. He was born on Sept. 8, 1941. It was just months before Japan\u2019s attack on Pearl Harbor that led to America entering World War II.\n\nSanders had a minor operation in November. Other than that, he appears to be healthy. Still, he should let people see a complete medical report. Then they will know if he is healthy enough to be president.\n\nHis main opponent, Hillary Clinton, has fainted four times since 1998. She fainted twice while serving as a U.S. senator from New York. She fainted two more times when she was the secretary of state.\n\nThe last time she fainted was in December 2012. She hit her head and got a concussion, a minor brain injury. She returned to work the next month.\n\nThe doctors of Clinton and Sanders released one-page letters in late January. They said their patients were in good health. Hillary\u2019s doctor, though, did not mention her fainting.\n\nOn the Republican side, Donald Trump appears healthy and is enjoying the campaign. He is even older than Clinton and has struggled off-and-on to lose weight.\n\nOther main Republican candidates are much younger than Sanders, Clinton and Trump. They may have medical problems that no one knows about.\n\nImportant Information\n\nAs of now, voters cannot look at the complete medical reports of leading Republican candidates. It is important information that would help people decide who to vote for.\n\nConsider the case of President Woodrow Wilson. He led the nation through World War I, which ended in 1918. Then he suffered a stroke. A stroke is when a blood vessel in the brain either is blocked or has burst. It causes serious damage.\n\nWilson believed in a world group that would try to solve disputes between nations. Wilson convinced the major European countries to create the world group. It was called the League of Nations. He included a League of Nations in the treaty which ended the war. American lawmakers did not approve it.\n\nWilson decided to ignore them. He took his case for the treaty to the American people with a cross-country train tour. His doctor told him not to go. Wilson began the tour on Sept. 3, 1919. He traveled 8,000 miles in 22 days.\n\nDuring the tour, Wilson began to have headaches. In late September, he collapsed in Pueblo, Colorado. He was rushed back to Washington, D.C. He suffered a near-fatal stroke on Oct. 2.\u00a0\n\nHis wife, Edith, called his doctor, and they decided to keep his condition from the American people. For the last 17 months of Wilson\u2019s presidency, his wife handled many of his job duties.\n\nWilson\u2019s illness teaches an important lesson. It shows why it is so important that American voters can see the medical records of the candidates.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Whitt Flora is journalist who formerly covered the White House at the Columbus Dispatch.\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers.

Clinton is a Democrat and Trump is a Republican. The Democrats and the Republicans are the main political groups in the United States. Clinton and Trump have some of the health risks that comes with old age. It does not matter.\n\nIn the past, people thought that a candidate's medical history and age was important. This kind of thinking is not true anymore.\n\nIn 2008, Barack Obama was running against Senator John McCain for president. Obama\u2019s team loved to talk about McCain\u2019s age. McCain, the Republican candidate, was 72 years old.\n\nMedical Advances And Healthy Living\n\nClinton is 68 and Trump is 69. Clinton fell and hit her head while secretary of state. Trump has spoken about his poor eating habits. Both struggle with their weight.\n\nTheir age makes it more likely they will have medical problems.\n\nYet people should not worry about their age. Even a history of medical problems is not important. If these health problems make it hard for them to do their job right now, that might be another story.\n\nMedical discoveries and healthy living are making people live longer. They also remain stronger and more active.\n\nToday, we have drugs and medical devices. Health problems like heart disease don't affect people as much as they used to. Better tests and frequent visits to the doctor mean that many diseases are found early. Then they often can be cured.\n\nRecent presidents have had medical problems. They have not really gotten in the way of being president.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan had cancer while in office. It is a disease where cells in the body grow too fast. He had an operation to remove the cancer. President George H.W. Bush had heart problems. President Bill Clinton underwent open heart surgery for heart disease less than four years after leaving office.\n\nTreating Health Problems Today\n\nSome things are known about the health of the main candidates. Some of them have conditions that could increase their risk for a future health problem. None of them have a medical problem that should harm their ability to be president or slow them down.\n\nThe kinds of things that put people at risk in the past are not really problems now. They are being solved by technology. Scientists did a study of men born before 1913. They found that high blood pressure was the top risk factor for death from stroke. A stroke is a blocked or burst blood vessel in the brain.\n\nToday, there are great drugs to treat high blood pressure. Now smoking is becoming the leading cause of death. Deaths from cancer are falling as more cancers are caught early. They are also being cured by drugs.\n\nMany people have had a medical problem. Almost all of us will one day. It is a struggle to be sick. Yet it can also make people stronger.\n\nAt one time, a health problem meant that a person should not be president. Now, it can be a reason to earn people's votes.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Scott Gottlieb is a practicing doctor who has worked for the government at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers.

Many leaders and businesspeople came to the meeting from different countries.\u00a0\n\nThey talked about the Fourth Industrial Revolution. An industrial revolution is a time of great change in technology. They talked mainly about the tech marvels just starting. Klaus Schwab is the head of the WEF. He said the Fourth Industrial Revolution is beginning now. The group talked about things like robotics and space travel.\n\nYet, they also talked about one of the world's oldest problems. There is a war going on in Syria in the Middle East. Millions of people have escaped. They are entering Europe in large numbers. The people are called refugees. Many of them cross the sea on leaky boats. They sleep on floors in train stations. The question is how to care for these refugees.\n\nImagining Tomorrow's Technology\n\nAt the meeting was an exhibit called \"This Time Tomorrow.\" The exhibit showed six possible futures. One was a world with three-dimensional models of human faces. They were made from a single piece of DNA. DNA contains the instructions for life and tells the body how to grow. In another, buildings are covered with a material that cleans the air.\n\nOther exhibits were about important problems now. People could use a virtual reality headset. They could feel what it is like to be a refugee. They could also put on a headscarf and be treated like refugees. Most of the refugees are Muslim. Many Muslim women wear headscarves.\n\nWorld Peace Depends On Human Will\n\nMost of the refugees use the Internet. They have smartphones. They get advice through Facebook on how to get to Europe.\u00a0These refugees have been called \u201cFacebook refugees.\"\u00a0\n\nAlessandra Morelli is an official with the United Nations. Countries all over the world belong to the United Nations. Thousands of Syrian refugees have arrived on a Greek island from Turkey, she said. Facebook posts showed them what kinds of tents to buy.

Photo: AP/Lefteris Pitarakis\nDAVOS, Switzerland \u2013- The World Economic Forum (WEF) is an annual meeting of world leaders and businesspeople in Davos, Switzerland. Its theme this year was the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It could also have been: Of Robots and Refugees. Although much of the meeting focused on the technological marvels of the near future, it also dealt with the world's inability to address one of humanity\u2019s oldest problems: how to feed, house and care for large populations driven from their homes by war.\n\nThe First Industrial Revolution was the invention of the steam engine and mechanical production of goods like textiles. The second was defined by electricity and factories. The third was the digital revolution, which began in the 1960s with the invention of computers, semiconductors and the Internet.\n\nAccording to WEF Chairman Klaus Schwab, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is beginning now. It started with widespread and mobile Internet, \"by smaller and more powerful sensors that have become cheaper, and by artificial intelligence and machine learning.\u201d It is creating a world in which virtual and actual systems are combined in manufacturing, services and the human body itself.\n\nLooking At Next New Marvels\n\nThe WEF\u2019s programs featured discussions on robotics, biotechnology and space travel. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London, England, created an interactive exhibit called \u201cThis Time Tomorrow.\u201d It featured six possible futures. These included worlds in which full three-dimensional casts of human faces can be created from a single strand of DNA; buildings are covered with a \"skin\" that uses photosynthesis, like leaves, to take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen; and death can be beaten by bringing back those who choose to be cryogenically frozen.\n\nOther exhibits, however, focused on urgent current problems. Participants were able to experience being a refugee through a virtual reality headset. They could instead put on a headscarf and spend 75 minutes being treated like a refugee and face heart-wrenching choices. Millions of real refugees have flooded into Europe, mainly fleeing civil war in Syria. They live in a world that is barely through the Second Industrial Revolution. They cram into leaky rafts to cross the Mediterranean Sea and sleep on the floors of railroad stations.\n\nYet the majority of the refugees had\u00a0Internet\u00a0access, which is part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Many received real-time advice through social media on their smartphones on how to make the journey.\n\nRefugees' Use Of Social Media\n\nMichel Bauwens is the founder of the Peer-to-Peer Foundation. It studies the effect of technology on society. He said 2015 was the year in which millions of refugees \"were organized by social media.\" These \u201cFacebook refugees\" used it not only to coordinate with smugglers who sneaked them into Europe, but also to help one another.\n\nAlessandra Morelli is an official with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Tens of thousands of Syrian refugees have arrived on the Greek island of Lesbos from Turkey. They \u201cknow exactly where they have to go, who they have to talk to. They know what to buy,\u201d she said. Facebook posts showed them what kinds of tents to purchase, which routes to take, and how to avoid being sent back out to sea if they were caught by Greek officials.\n\nTechnology Is Great But It's Just Part Of Answer\n\nThe question remains, however, whether robots and other high tech inventions can help refugees integrate into European societies or help them get back home. These countries are increasingly hostile to the refugees. It is easy enough to imagine them tracking the refugees in various ways -- for instance, scanning their irises to identify them.\u00a0\n\nCombine iris identification with new phones that identify its users, and any refugee using a smartphone could be found.\n\nYet no technology can successfully address the real problem: the conflicts from which millions of people are fleeing. Historically, we have been better at developing technologies to kill people than we have been at protecting them.\n\nBut Peace Ultimately Depends On People\n\nEarly in the Syrian civil war, the Syrian army committed many cruel acts. Rebels posted pictures of them on social media, and President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government claimed they were fake. At that point, it would have been possible for the United Nations to ensure the truth of the photos and videos posted. But no technology can overcome some governments\u2019 lack of will to speak up.\n\nLikewise, no technology can compel enemies to make peace. At the end of World War II, the United States dropped nuclear bombs on Japan to force it to surrender. However, it depended on President Harry S. Truman\u2019s will to use the bombs.\n\nP.W. Singer and August Cole\u2019s novel Ghost Fleet is set in a future war between the U.S. and China. The authors describe all of the astonishing technologies that both sides actually use. Micro-drones, robots and holograms are all in the book. But the outcome of the war is still determined by human will, courage and determination.

It was possible to experience being a refugee through a virtual reality headset \u2013 or through the actual experience of donning a headscarf and spending 75 minutes being treated like a refugee and facing heart-wrenching choices in a simulation created by the Crossroads Foundation. Many of the real refugees are living in a world that is barely through the Second Industrial Revolution. They cram into leaky rafts and place themselves at the mercy of the waves, and sleep on the floors of railroad stations.\n\nYet the majority of the million refugees flooding into Europe this past summer \u2013- primarily from Syria -\u2013 had access to that \u201cubiquitous and mobile Internet\u201d that is part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Many received real-time guidance via social media that they accessed on their smartphones.\n\nMichel Bauwens, founder of the Peer-to-Peer Foundation, describes 2015 as the year in which millions of refugees \u201cwere organized by social media (specifically through secret Facebook groups) and in which scores of citizens organized themselves through peer-to-peer networks to assist them.\u201d These \u201cFacebook refugees,\u201d as the press quickly dubbed them, used the platform not only to coordinate with smugglers, but also to help one another.\n\nAccording to UNHCR official Alessandra Morelli, the tens of thousands of Syrian refugees arriving on the Greek island of Lesbos \u201cknow exactly where they have to go, who they have to talk to. They know what to buy.\u201d Facebook posts showed them what kinds of tents to purchase, which routes to take, and what tactics to implement, such as slashing the rubber boats they arrived in to avoid being pushed back out to sea by Greek officials.\n\nThe question remains, however, whether robots or gene sequencing or micro-sensors can help refugees integrate into European societies that are increasingly hostile to them, or else help them get back home. It is easy enough to imagine tagging and tracking them in various ways. After all, the Unique Identification Authority of India has enrolled nearly a billion Indians in its biometric identification program, which relies on scanning the irises of participants\u2019 eyes.\n\nCombine iris identification with new phones (already issued by Microsoft) that use it to authenticate their users, and any refugee using his or her smartphone to connect to social media to find out where to go would also be signaling his or her location to border authorities.

They talk about making the world better. This year's meeting was in January. Its theme was the Fourth Industrial Revolution. An industrial revolution is a period of great change in technology.\n\nThe meeting also could have been called \"Of Robots and Refugees.\" Much of the meeting was about the technological marvels of the near future. However, it also discussed one of humanity\u2019s oldest problems. How should the world feed, house and care for people fleeing war in their home countries?\n\nThe First Industrial Revolution was the invention of the steam engine and machines to make goods like textiles. The second was electricity and factories. The third was the digital revolution. It began in the 1960s with the invention of computers and the Internet.\n\nDawn Of New Industrial Age\n\nWEF Chairman Klaus Schwab says the Fourth Industrial Revolution is beginning now. It can be seen in the ability to connect to the Internet from just about anywhere. Also, machines have begun to learn, leading to artificial intelligence.\n\nThe WEF\u2019s programs featured talks on robotics, biotechnology and space travel. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London, England, created an exhibit called \u201cThis Time Tomorrow.\u201d It presented six possible futures. One was a world where three-dimensional casts of human faces can be created from a single strand of DNA, the building blocks of life. In a second, buildings covered with a material work like leaves. The material takes in carbon dioxide and releases oxygen. In a third future, death can be defeated by freezing people and then bringing them back.\n\nOther exhibits, however, focused on urgent current problems. Participants were able to experience being a refugee through a virtual reality headset. They could also decide to put on a headscarf and face the hard choices that refugees are forced to make. Millions of real refugees have flooded into Europe, mainly fleeing war in Syria. Most of them are Muslim, and many Muslim women wear headscarfs. Many of the refugees squeeze into leaky boats to cross the Mediterranean Sea. In Europe, they sleep on the floors of railroad stations.\n\nTechnology Helps Today's Refugees\n\nYet most of the refugees use the Internet, which is part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. They get advice through social media on their smartphones.\n\nMichel Bauwens started the group Peer-to-Peer Foundation. It studied how technology affects society. He said 2015 was the year when millions of refugees \"were organized by social media.\" They have been called \u201cFacebook refugees,\" because they use it to help each other.\n\nAlessandra Morelli is an official with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Tens of thousands of Syrian refugees have arrived on the Greek island of Lesbos from Turkey, she said. Facebook posts showed them what kinds of tents to buy and which routes to take. They \u201cknow exactly where they have to go, who they have to talk to. They know what to buy,\u201d she said.\n\nBut It Can Harm Them Too\n\nCan robots and other high-tech inventions help refugees become part of European societies, or help them get back home? European countries are not happy about all the refugees. It is easy to imagine them using technology to track the refugees and keep them out.\n\nStill, no technology can solve the real problem. It cannot end the wars which millions of people are escaping. We have been better at developing technologies to kill people than protect them.\n\nLikewise, no technology can force enemies to make peace. In 1945, the United States dropped nuclear bombs on Japan to force it to surrender and end World War II. President Harry S. Truman had to make the decision to use the bombs.\n\nEnding a war depends on human will and courage.

The Victoria and Albert Museum in London, England, created an interactive exhibit called \u201cThis Time Tomorrow.\u201d It featured six scenarios of possible futures, including a world in which full three-dimensional casts of human faces can be created from a single strand of DNA; buildings are covered with a skin capable of photosynthesis, so it can act like leaves, taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen; and death can be beaten by bringing back those who choose to be cryogenically frozen.\n\nOther exhibits, however, focused on urgent current problems. Participants were able to experience being a refugee through a virtual reality headset. They could also don a headscarf and spend 75 minutes being treated like a refugee and face heart-wrenching choices. Many of the real refugees who flooded into Europe this past summer are living in a world that is barely through the Second Industrial Revolution. They cram into leaky rafts and place themselves at the mercy of ocean waves, and sleep on the floors of railroad stations.\n\nYet the majority of the millions refugees headed to Europe \u2013- primarily fleeing civil war in Syria -\u2013 had access to the Internet that is part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Many received real-time advice via social media on their smartphones on how to make the journey.\n\nNew Age For The Refugee\n\nMichel Bauwens is the founder of the Peer-to-Peer Foundation. He described 2015 as the year in which millions of refugees \u201cwere organized by social media (specifically through secret Facebook groups) and in which scores of citizens organized themselves through peer-to-peer networks to assist them.\u201d These \u201cFacebook refugees,\u201d as the media quickly dubbed them, used Facebook not only to coordinate with smugglers but also to help one another.\n\nAlessandra Morelli is an official with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

Facebook posts showed them what kinds of tents to purchase, which routes to take, and how to avoid being pushed back out to sea by Greek officials.\n\nBut Technology Works Against Them Too\n\nThe question remains, however, whether robots or gene sequencing or micro-sensors can help refugees integrate into European societies or else help them get back home. These countries are increasingly hostile to them, and it is easy enough to imagine them tracking the refugees in various ways. After all, the Unique Identification Authority of India has enrolled nearly a billion Indians in its biometric identification program and scans the irises of participants\u2019 eyes.\n\nCombine iris identification with new phones that identify its users, and any refugee using a smartphone would also signal his or her location.

Photo: AP/Toby Talbot\nPRO: Using more nuclear energy will stop greenhouse gases\nNuclear power plants produce energy by splitting apart the nucleus, or center, of atoms. When the nucleus is split, heat is released. That newly released energy is then used to produce electricity. In turn, that electricity is sent through a grid to light our homes and power our computers.\u00a0\n\nNuclear power is only one of many ways of producing electricity. However, it is superior to any other method for one important reason.\u00a0It is the best way to produce carbon-free electric power.\u00a0\n\nCarbon is in carbon dioxide and other gases. It is released or emitted when fuels like coal, gas or oil are burned. People burn these fuels to power cars and all sorts of machinery.\u00a0\n\nCarbon-containing gases are the main cause of the so-called greenhouse effect. Once they are released through the burning of fuels, they remain in the atmosphere and trap heat, just as heat is trapped in a greenhouse. Over time, this has caused average global temperatures to rise.\u00a0\n\nA Valuable Tool\n\nThe global increase in average temperature is known as climate change or global warming. It is putting the planet at risk. Polar ice caps are starting to melt, thereby causing ocean levels to rise. Increasingly, coastlines and island nations are being submerged. In other parts of the world, droughts are becoming common as lakes and rivers dry up.\n\nThe world is starting to come together to try to limit climate change. Clearly, a carbon-free source of energy like nuclear power is a valuable tool in that effort.\n\nNuclear power now accounts for more than 60 percent of the United States' zero-carbon electricity. It is playing an essential part in the battle to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWind power and solar power can also produce energy without releasing carbon. However, they are not constant. To work, the sun has to be out, or the wind has to be blowing.\n\nNuclear power plants run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They are the only constant source of power that does not emit greenhouse gases.\n\nAn Excellent Safety Record\n\nMany claim nuclear power is dangerous. Nuclear power plants produce radiation, which can be a dangerous form of energy. Even a small amount can cause severe damage to living things. Nuclear plants are built to keep radiation from leaking out, but many people worry such leaking will happen anyway.\n\nActually, there is no reason for concern. The nuclear power industry has an excellent safety record.\u00a0\n\nThe first commercial nuclear reactor began producing electricity more than 50 years ago. In all that time, there has not been a single death or injury from a radiation-related nuclear power plant accident in the United States.\u00a0\n\nMany other countries also successfully rely on nuclear power. In France, nuclear power supplies 75 percent of the electricity, with enough to spare to provide almost a quarter of the electricity in Europe.\u00a0\n\nThe picture is very different in China, the world\u2019s biggest carbon polluter. There, nuclear energy provides only 2 percent of the power. Coal remains China\u2019s main energy source, and its use is increasing not only in China but throughout Asia.\n\nLast month, representatives of most of the world's nations met in Paris, France, to discuss the climate crisis. The agreement they signed was far-reaching. It set a goal of bringing carbon emissions down to zero by the second half of this century.\n\nMeeting that goal might seem impossible. However, France and Sweden show that countries can change their energy use very quickly. Both have been able to greatly increase their use of carbon-fee nuclear power in a relatively short time.\n\nReducing The Need For Oil\n\nIf the world built nuclear reactors at the same rate as France and Sweden have, the effect would be enormous. In 25 to 34 years, all the electricity now produced though burning coal and natural gas could be produced by nuclear power.\n\nDuring this period, electric vehicles powered by nuclear-generated electricity could dramatically reduce the need for oil. These changes would greatly lower global carbon emissions and would help prevent dangerous climate change.\n\nMeeting the new climate control goals is a daunting challenge. The world\u2019s population is expected to increase to more than 9 billion by 2040. As a result, global demand for electricity will nearly double.\n\nUnless the use of nuclear power is greatly increased, it will be impossible to both meet\u00a0future energy demand and prevent dangerous climate change. Nuclear power is the only way to achieve both those goals at the same time.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\u00a0Mark J.

It calls on all countries to greatly reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMost of these emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. The message could not be clearer: We need to change the way we generate and use energy, and do so quickly.\n\nThe United States set itself a modest goal. It has pledged to cut emissions by around a quarter by 2025. The country has already taken some steps to meet that goal, but much more is needed.\n\nPerhaps the most realistic approach is to increase the use of both nuclear power and renewable energy. Renewable energy sources, also called renewables, include such things as wind power and solar power.\n\nA Better Bet\n\nChina has been using this approach. It plans to double its nuclear power capacity, and has 24 new plants now under construction. However, it is also expanding its use of wind and solar power.\n\nShould the United States do the same? Yes, but only in part. Currently, our 99 nuclear reactors only account for about 8 percent of the electricity the U.S. consumes. Most of the energy we use, about 81 percent, comes from fossil fuels.\n\nNuclear power will have an important part to play, but it is unlikely to replace much fossil fuel use. It is still too expensive and too risky.\n\nA better bet is to expand the use of renewables, while also working to make our energy use less wasteful.\n\nGlobally, nuclear electricity production has been leveling off while wind and solar power are soaring. There are good reasons for this.\n\nOne is cost. The new nuclear plants now being built in the U.S. are expected to cost $8 billion to $9 billion each, possibly more. It is also very expensive to safely shut down plants, which eventually becomes necessary when they are too old.\n\nThese very high costs make it difficult for the private utilities that provide our electricity to increase nuclear power generation. They see more promise and lower costs in natural gas-powered plants or in turning to renewables.\n\nNuclear Waste, And A Disaster\n\nThe problem of radioactive waste is another big reason to avoid an increase in nuclear power. There is currently no acceptable way to dispose of the highly radioactive waste nuclear plants create.\u00a0\n\nThere is also always the chance of the kind of disaster that occurred in Fukushima, Japan. In 2011, an earthquake there caused radiation-contaminated water to leak out of a nuclear plant, poisoning the surrounding area. The U.S. public remains understandably concerned that such a disaster could happen here.\n\nA better way is for the country to greatly increase its use of renewables. At the same time, we should try to use energy in a way that is less wasteful. A non-wasteful use of energy is known as energy efficiency.\n\nThere are many ways to cut down on wasteful energy loss. Among them are improved building design, and a greater use of trains and buses in place of cars. We should modernize our electrical grid, and design better lighting, heating and cooling systems.\n\nThe United States also should put more money into research on promising new types of energy.\n\nThe federal government has long favored nuclear power and fossil fuels. For the past 10 years, renewables and energy efficiency have begun to receive significant support. We should keep moving in that direction, and quickly.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\u00a0Michael Kraft is professor emeritus of political science and public and environmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.

Perry and Michael E. Kraft, Tribune News Service\n02.05.16\n\nDry cask storage units of nuclear fuel are pictured at the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant in Vernon, Vermont, June 9, 2009. Photo: AP/Toby Talbot\nPRO: Nuclear power is our safest, most efficient energy form\nDespite competition from cheap natural gas and taxpayer-subsidized wind and solar energy, nuclear power has no equal.\n\nAmong sources of electric-power generation, it dominates the production of carbon-free power, and is likely to do so well into the future.\n\nWith nuclear power accounting for more than 60 percent of the country\u2019s zero-carbon electricity and a new generation of technologically advanced reactors on the horizon, the power source is playing a crucial role in the battle to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Even environmentalists should welcome nuclear power\u2019s benefits.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that nuclear is the only 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week source of power that does not result in the emission of greenhouse gases,\u201d says Eileen Claussen, former president and founder of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe we can limit temperature increases, and their associated impacts, without a vastly expanded use of nuclear energy.\u201d\n\nContrary to the assertions of those who disparage it, nuclear power has an excellent safety record. In more than a half-century since the first commercial nuclear reactor began producing electricity under the leadership of Adm. Hyman Rickover, there has not been a single fatality or injury from a radiation-related nuclear power plant accident in the United States. No other major industry has a comparable safety record.\n\nNuclear power has endured because it has proved reliable, effective and affordable. The basic facts are not in dispute among energy policymakers.\n\nIn America, the performance of nuclear plants has improved significantly since 1990. In 2014, according to the Energy Information Administration, the capacity factor \u2014 how often a power plant actually delivers power to the electric grid \u2014 for about 100 operating reactors was 90 percent.\n\nThe average capacity factor in 1998 was 80 percent, compared to only 66 percent in 1990. Despite a reduction in the number of plants, the U.S. nuclear industry actually generated more electricity last year than it did in 2005.\n\nGlobally, with 439 operating reactors around the world, nuclear power is meeting the annual electrical needs of more than a billion people. Almost 70 reactors are under construction, including five in the United States, and another 159 are on order or planned.\n\nIn France, nuclear supplies 75 percent of the electricity, with enough to spare to provide almost a quarter of the electricity in Europe. But in China, the world\u2019s biggest carbon polluter, nuclear provides only 2 percent of the power. Coal remains China\u2019s energy mainstay, and its use is increasing not only in China but throughout Asia.\n\nNow, in the aftermath of the Paris climate agreement, nuclear power is expected to take on increasing importance. The climate accord calls for net carbon emissions to be effectively brought down to zero \u201cin the second half of this century.\u201d\n\nThis would seem, at first glance, an impossible task. Until, that is, you consider the speed with which France and Sweden ramped up their use of nuclear power.\n\nIn a study of the growth of the French and Swedish nuclear programs from the 1960s to the 1990s, a team of European energy experts noted that if the world were to build nuclear reactors at the same rate as the French and Swedish did, then electricity from coal and natural gas, in a politically conservative scenario, could be replaced in 25-34 years.\n\nDuring this period, electric vehicles powered by nuclear-generated electricity could dramatically reduce the need for oil. These changes would have a huge impact on global carbon emissions and avert dangerous climate change.\n\nThe challenge to meet the new climate control goals is daunting. If present trends continue, the world\u2019s population will increase to more than 9 billion by 2040, with global electricity demand nearly doubling.\n\nEffectively meeting this dramatic rise in future energy demand while simultaneously trying to avert dangerous climate change will likely be nearly impossible unless zero-carbon nuclear is up-scaled to meet those twin goals.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\u00a0Mark J.

Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of Tribune or its editors.\nCON: Renewables are a better bet than expensive, risky nuclear power\nIn December, delegates from 195 nations meeting in Paris approved a remarkable global climate agreement. It calls for all countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases substantially.\n\nMost of these emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels \u2014 coal, oil and natural gas \u2014 and the message couldn\u2019t be clearer: We need to change the way we generate and use energy, and do so quickly.\n\nThe United States set a modest goal: cutting emissions by 26-28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.\n\nIn the face of persistent congressional opposition to climate change policy, President Barack Obama has used executive authority to move toward that goal, most notably through the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which will regulate coal-fired power plants and new vehicle fuel economy standards.\n\nThe question now is what additional policy actions will most help in meeting \u2014 or preferably, exceeding \u2014 the target for emission reductions.\n\nShould we rely on a revenue-neutral carbon tax that returns all new fees to citizens by lowering other taxes? What about a cap-and-trade system that many U.S. states now use? Both are very appealing but face political resistance.\n\nAnother approach may be more realistic. This is to expand and redirect investment in energy technology to favor low-energy or no-carbon energy sources, among them nuclear power and renewable energy, and to greatly improve energy efficiency.\n\nChina understands this strategy. It plans to double its nuclear power capacity, and has 24 new plants now under construction. But China also is investing heavily in wind and solar power, as it has been for years.\n\nShould the U.S. do the same? Yes, but only in part. Currently, our 99 nuclear reactors generate about 19 percent of electrical output, yet only about 8 percent of total energy consumption. The lion\u2019s share of the energy we use, about 81 percent, comes from fossil fuels.\n\nNuclear power will have an important role to play, but it is unlikely to replace much fossil fuel use. It is still too expensive and too risky.\n\nA better bet is to invest in renewables and energy efficiency, which most of the world is now doing.\n\nDespite construction of new reactors by China and other Asian nations, globally nuclear electricity production has been leveling off while wind and solar power are soaring. There are good reasons for these trends.\n\nOne is cost. The nuclear plants under construction in the U.S., the first after more than three decades, are expected to cost $8 billion to $9 billion each, possibly more, and the eventual decommissioning of reactors remains expensive.\n\nThese very high costs make it difficult for private utilities to increase nuclear power generation despite generous federal loan guarantees. They see more promise and lower costs in natural gas-powered plants or in turning to renewable energy.\n\nOther reasons include dealing with waste and safety. Even if the industry can reduce costs through improved technology and reactor design, what do we do about high-level waste disposal, for which no acceptable solution is in sight? And how should we address public concerns over reactor safety after the Fukushima disaster?\n\nA better way forward is to invest heavily in renewables as well as in energy conservation and efficiency, which can cut energy demand sharply.\n\nThis includes improved building design, greater reliance on public transit, enhanced transportation efficiency, modernization of the electrical grid and storage technologies, and better lighting, heating and cooling systems.\n\nWe also should put more funds into research on promising energy technologies to speed up innovation and commercial development, as Bill Gates and the Breakthrough Energy Coalition have advocated.\n\nThe federal government has long favored and heavily subsidized nuclear power and fossil fuels. For the past decade, renewables and efficiency finally have begun to receive significant support. We should accelerate that trend.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\u00a0Michael Kraft is professor emeritus of political science and public and environmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.

Photo: AP/Toby Talbot\nPRO: Nuclear power is the best way to go\nElectricity is very important. We use it for many things. We use it to light our homes. We use it to run our computers.\u00a0\n\nMany kinds of power are used to make electricity. The best is nuclear power.\u00a0\n\nNuclear power comes from splitting the nucleus of an atom. Tiny atoms are everywhere. Everything is built out of them. The nucleus is the center part of an atom.\u00a0\n\nHeat is released when a nucleus is split. The heat can be turned into a kind of power. Nuclear power is made in buildings called nuclear power plants.\n\nNo Carbon\n\nNuclear power is the best way to make electricity. It does not give off carbon.\n\nCarbon is in the gases that are given off when fuels are burned. Fuel is one kind of power. Coal, gas or oil are all fuels. People burn fuels to run cars and machines.\u00a0\n\nWhen carbon gases are given off they remain in the air. They trap heat.\u00a0Scientists call this the greenhouse effect.\n\nOver time, the greenhouse effect has made the world hotter.\u00a0Scientists call this climate change or global warming.\u00a0\n\nGlobal warming is causing all kinds of serious problems. In some places, lakes and rivers are drying up. There is no longer enough water.\u00a0\n\nIn other places, ice is melting. So much ice is melting that the ocean is rising. Some small island countries are sinking under water.\n\nThe world is starting to come together to fight climate change. Nuclear power can help. The more we use it, the less carbon will be given off into the air.\n\nThe Sun And The Wind\n\nWind power and solar power do not give off carbon either. They do not work all the time, though. The sun has to be out for solar power to work. The wind has to be blowing for wind power to work.\n\nNuclear power plants run 24 hours a day.

There is no other way to stop global warming. Something must be done soon. We are all in danger.\n\nNuclear power is part of the answer. Renewable energy is an even better idea, though. Wind power and solar power are two kinds of renewable energy.\n\nThese renewables are both cheaper and safer. We should try to use them much more than we do now.\u00a0\n\nMany countries are using less nuclear power these days. At the same time, they are using wind and solar power more. There are good reasons for this.\n\nOne is cost. Nuclear plants cost billions of dollars to build. Renewables are much cheaper.\n\nA Bad Nuclear Accident\n\nNuclear plants also may not be as safe as they seem. There is always the chance that something will go wrong.\u00a0\n\nIn 2011, something terrible did happen in Fukushima, Japan. A huge earthquake shook the ground and knocked down buildings. A nuclear plant was hit and radiation began leaking out. The land nearby was poisoned. People had to leave their homes.\u00a0\n\nSomething like that could happen here.\n\nInstead of more nuclear power, the United States should use more renewables. We also should try not to waste power. Using power in a way that is not wasteful is known as energy efficiency.\n\nThere are many ways to be more energy efficient. For example, we can switch to new kinds of lights that use less electricity.\u00a0\n\nFor years, the U.S. government has favored nuclear power and fuels. Now, finally, people are thinking about renewables and energy efficiency. We should keep moving in that direction. We should do it fast, too.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\u00a0Michael Kraft is professor of political science and public and environmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers.

Photo: AP/Toby Talbot\nPRO: Nuclear energy can cut our carbon emissions to zero\nDespite competition from natural gas and wind and solar energy, nuclear power has no equal.\u00a0It is the best way to produce carbon-free electric power, and is likely to remain so well into the future.\u00a0\n\nCarbon emissions are the main cause of the greenhouse effect that is producing global warming. Carbon-containing gases released by the burning of fuels are remaining in the atmosphere and trapping heat. Over time, they have caused average global temperatures to rise, putting the planet at risk. Clearly, a carbon-free source of energy is a valuable resource in the fight against planet-threatening climate change.\n\nNuclear power now accounts for more than 60 percent of the United States' zero-carbon electricity and a new generation of technologically advanced reactors is on the horizon. Nuclear power is playing an essential role in the battle to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Even environmentalists should welcome its benefits.\n\n\u201cNuclear is the only 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week source of power that does not result in the emission of greenhouse gases,\u201d says energy expert Eileen Claussen. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe we can limit temperature increases, and their associated impacts, without a vastly expanded use of nuclear energy.\u201d\n\nReliable, Effective And Affordable\n\nMany claim that nuclear power is dangerous because of the risk of radiation leaks. In fact, the industry has an excellent safety record. In the more than a half-century since the first commercial nuclear reactor began producing electricity, there has not been a single death or injury from a radiation-related nuclear power plant accident in the United States. No other major industry has an equally good safety record.\n\nNuclear power has endured because it has proved reliable, effective and affordable. The basic facts are not in dispute among energy policymakers.\n\nIn America, the performance of nuclear plants has improved significantly since 1990. The average capacity factor \u2014 how often a power plant actually delivers power to the electric grid \u2014 has steadily gone up.\u00a0In 2014, it was at 90 percent for the approximately\u00a0100 operating U.S. reactors.\n\nThe average capacity factor in 1998 was 80 percent, compared to only 66 percent in 1990. Despite a reduction in the number of plants, the U.S. nuclear industry actually generated more electricity last year than it did in 2005.\n\nThe 439 reactors now operating around the world are meeting the annual electrical needs of more than a billion people. Almost 70 reactors are under construction, including five in the United States. Another 159 are on order or planned.\n\nIn France, nuclear power supplies 75 percent of the electricity, with enough to spare to provide almost a quarter of the electricity in Europe. However, in China, the world\u2019s biggest carbon polluter, nuclear energy provides only 2 percent of the power. Coal remains China\u2019s main energy source, and its use is increasing not only in China but throughout Asia.\n\nMeeting Two Global Goals\n\nIn December of last year, representatives of most of the world's nations met in Paris, France, to discuss ways to combat climate change. The agreement they signed set an ambitious global goal: bringing net carbon emissions down to zero by the second half of this century.\n\nThis would seem, at first glance, an impossible task. Until, that is, you consider that both France and Sweden have been able to greatly increase their use of carbon-fee nuclear power in a relatively short time.\n\nEuropean energy experts say the results would be dramatic if the world were to build nuclear reactors at the same rate as the French and Swedish have. Electricity from coal and natural gas could be replaced in 25 to 34 years.\n\nDuring this period, electric vehicles powered by nuclear-generated electricity could dramatically reduce the need for oil. These changes would have a huge impact on global carbon emissions and would help prevent dangerous climate change.\n\nThe challenge to meet the new climate control goals is daunting. If present trends continue, the world\u2019s population will increase to more than 9 billion by 2040, with global electricity demand nearly doubling.\n\nUnless the use of zero-carbon nuclear power is greatly increased, it likely will be impossible to both meet\u00a0future energy demand and prevent dangerous climate change. Nuclear power is the only way to achieve both those goals at the same time.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\u00a0Mark J.

It calls for all countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases substantially.\n\nMost of these emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels \u2014 coal, oil and natural gas \u2014 and the message could not be clearer: We need to change the way we generate and use energy, and do so quickly.\n\nThe United States set itself a modest goal: cutting emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.\n\nDespite opposition from Congress, President Barack Obama has moved toward that goal. The most notable step so far is the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean Power Plan. The plan will regulate coal-fired power plants and set new vehicle fuel-economy standards.\n\nEmbracing Renewable Energy\n\nThe question now is what additional policy actions will most help in meeting \u2014 or preferably exceeding \u2014 the target for emission reductions.\n\nPerhaps the most realistic approach is to increase the use of low-energy or no-carbon energy sources, among them nuclear power and renewable energy. Renewable energy sources, also called renewables, include such things as wind power and solar power.\n\nChina has embraced this approach. It plans to double its nuclear power capacity, and has 24 new plants now under construction. However, China also is investing heavily in wind and solar power, as it has been for years.\n\nShould the U.S. do the same? Yes, but only in part. Currently, our 99 nuclear reactors generate about 19 percent of electrical output, yet only account for about 8 percent of total energy consumption. The lion\u2019s share of the energy we use, about 81 percent, comes from fossil fuels.\n\nNuclear power will have an important role to play, but it is unlikely to replace much fossil fuel use. It is still too expensive and too risky.\n\nA better bet is to invest in renewables, while also working to make our energy use more efficient, as most of the world is now doing.\n\nNuclear Power Is Very Expensive\n\nDespite construction of new reactors by China and other Asian nations, globally nuclear electricity production has been leveling off while wind and solar power are soaring. There are good reasons for these trends.\n\nOne is cost. The nuclear plants under construction in the United States, the first after more than three decades, are expected to cost $8 billion to $9 billion each, possibly more. It is also very expensive to safely shut down plants, which eventually becomes necessary.\n\nThese very high costs make it difficult for the private utilities that provide our electricity to increase nuclear power generation. They see more promise and lower costs in natural gas-powered plants or in turning to renewables.\n\nThe difficulty of disposing of the radioactive waste that nuclear plants create is another\u00a0big reason to avoid an increase in nuclear power. There is currently no acceptable nuclear waste disposal method.\u00a0\n\nThere is also always the chance of the kind of disaster that occurred when Japan's Fukushima plant leaked radiation-contaminated water, poisoning the surrounding area. The U.S. public remains understandably concerned that such a disaster could occur here.\n\nA better way is to invest heavily in renewables, as well as in energy conservation and efficiency. Both conservation and increased energy efficiency can cut energy demand sharply.\n\nWe Must Act Quickly\n\nIncreased energy efficiency and conservation can be achieved in a variety of ways. Among them are improved building design, greater reliance on public transit, modernization of the electrical grid, and better lighting, heating and cooling systems.\n\nThe United States should put more funds into research on promising energy technologies.\n\nThe federal government has long favored and heavily subsidized nuclear power and fossil fuels. For the past decade, renewables and efficiency finally have begun to receive significant support. We should accelerate that trend.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\u00a0Michael Kraft is professor emeritus of political science and public and environmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.

Photo: AP/Toby Talbot\nPRO: Nuclear power does not emit greenhouse gases\nElectricity is very important for modern life. We use it for countless things. We use it to light our homes and to power our computers.\u00a0\n\nMany kinds of power can be used to make electricity. The best is nuclear power.\u00a0\n\nNuclear power comes from splitting the nucleus of an atom. Tiny atoms are the building blocks of all matter. The nucleus is the center part of an atom.\u00a0\n\nHeat is released when a nucleus is split. The heat can be turned into a kind of power. Nuclear power used for electricity is made in buildings called nuclear power plants.\n\nStopping The Greenhouse Effect\n\nThere is one simple reason why nuclear power is the best way to make electricity. It does not give off carbon.\n\nCarbon is in carbon dioxide and other gases. It is given off or emitted when fuels like coal, gas or oil are burned. People burn these fuels to power cars and all sorts of machines.\u00a0\n\nCarbon gases are the main cause of the greenhouse effect. Once they are released, they remain in the air and trap heat. Over time, this has made the world hotter.\u00a0\n\nScientists call this climate change or global warming.\u00a0\n\nGlobal warming is causing all kinds of serious problems. Polar ice caps are starting to melt. As a result, ocean levels are rising. Coastlines and small islands are being swallowed up by water. In other parts of the world, lakes and rivers are drying up. There is no longer enough water.\n\nThe world is starting to come together to try to fight climate change. Nuclear power can help. The more we use it, the less carbon will be released into the air.\n\nWorries About Radiation\n\nWind power and solar power do not give off carbon either. However, they do not work all the time. The sun has to be out for solar power to work. The wind has to be blowing for wind power to work.\n\nNuclear power plants run 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nMany people think nuclear power is dangerous. They worry about radiation escaping from nuclear power plants. Radiation can be deadly. Even a small amount of it can kill.\u00a0\n\nNuclear plants are built to keep radiation from leaking out. Still, many people worry something will happen anyway.\n\nActually, they have no reason to worry. Nuclear power plants are very safe.\n\nThe United States has had nuclear power plants for more than 50 years. In that time, not one person in the U.S. has been killed or hurt by a radiation leak.\n\nThe Only Answer\n\nLast month, world leaders gathered in Paris, France, to talk about ways to stop global warming. They agreed that every country will have to cut back on the amount of greenhouse gases it emits each year. Some countries will have to cut back a great deal.\n\nThe goal is to have zero greenhouse gas emissions by around 2050.\n\nMeeting that target will be very difficult. By 2040, there will be 9 billion people in the world, almost 2 billion more than there are now. There will be much more demand for electricity.\n\nThe only answer is to use nuclear power much more than we do now. Nuclear power is the only way to give people the electricity they need while stopping global warming. There is no other way to do both things at the same time.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\u00a0Mark J.

There is no other way to stop global warming. Something must be done soon because we are all in danger.\n\nPerhaps the best plan is to use both more nuclear power and more renewable energy. Solar power and wind power are two kinds of renewable energy.\n\nThere is definitely a place for nuclear power. However, renewable energy is a better way to go. It is both cheaper and safer. We should try to use more renewable energy. We should also try to be less wasteful in the way we use power.\n\nProblems With Nuclear Power\n\nAround the world, many countries are using less nuclear power. At the same time, they are using solar and wind power more. There are good reasons for this.\n\nOne is cost. Nuclear plants are very expensive. They can cost as much as $9 billion to build. It is also very expensive to shut them down safely, without any radiation leaking out. Sooner or later, all plants have to be shut down when they get too old.\n\nThere is also no good way to store radioactive waste once it is taken from a plant. You can bury it, but that will not stop the radiation from spreading. It can still slowly leak into the ground, water and air.\n\nThere is also always the chance that something will go wrong, no matter how safe a plant seems. In 2011, Fukushima, Japan, had a terrible earthquake. A nuclear plant was damaged and radioactive water leaked out. The surrounding area was poisoned and people were forced to leave. It is always possible that something like that could happen here.\n\nEnergy Efficiency\n\nA better idea is for the United States to begin using more renewable energy. We should also try to be less wasteful with the power we use. Using power in a way that is not wasteful is known as energy efficiency.\n\nThere are many ways to be more energy efficient. For example, we can switch to new kinds of lights that use less electricity. We can\u00a0change the way buildings are made, so that they lose less heat. We can all use trains and buses more, and cars less. If we did that, we would burn much less fuel.\u00a0\n\nFor years, the U.S. government has favored nuclear power and fossil fuels. Now, finally, people are starting to pay more attention to renewable energy and energy efficiency. We should keep moving in that direction, and quickly.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\u00a0Michael Kraft is professor of political science and public and environmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers.

Photo: AP/Anupam Nath\nNEW DELHI, India \u2013 It is a blot on the face of humanity that we have not yet wiped out child slavery. Not only does child slavery persist, but the number of child slaves, 5.5 million, has remained constant in the last two decades. Children are bought and sold like animals, sometimes for less than a pack of cigarettes. In addition, there are 68 million child laborers, 59 million children who do not go to school and 15 million girls younger than 15 who are forced to marry every year. The situation is completely unacceptable.\n\nEighteen years ago, the Global March Against Child Labour led a worldwide movement to bring child labor and child slavery to the attention of world leaders. The campaign was a complete success. It led to the adoption of the International Labour Organization\u2019s Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention. Countries that signed it promised to stop children from working in especially dangerous jobs.\n\nClearly, however, there is much work left to do. The organization has collected 550,000 signatures on a petition to push the United Nations to include strong language against child slavery in its Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Among its goals, the SDG seeks to end forced labor, slavery and human trafficking, and to stop the worst forms of child labor.\n\nGroups, Individuals Must Pressure Leaders\n\nBut now it is time to back that promise with action. After all, if child labor, slavery, human trafficking and violence against children continue, the SDG would have failed. And the responsibility does not lie only with governments. Businesses, organizations and individual citizens must all contribute, not least by pressuring their leaders to make a change.\n\nConsider the situation in India. The country is considering making changes to two major policies, the National Education Policy and the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act. On the one hand, a new education policy would put limits on child labor, because many child workers do not go to school. It also aims to improve the life of millions of poor and powerless children. On the other hand, the proposed amendments to the Child Labour Act would have the opposite effect.\n\nSpecifically, the changes to the Child Labour Act would allow children younger than\u00a0 age 14 to help their families in \u201cnon-hazardous\u201d family businesses or the entertainment industry. This may sound innocent, but it fails to acknowledge reality. Family businesses can be as brutal as any other kind of jobs, and the list of \u201chazardous\u201d occupations is far from complete.\n\nChildren Can Suffer In Family Business\n\nBefore being rescued by my organization, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, 8-year-old Arpita was forced to work 16- to 18-hour days in the home of her uncle as a servant. When we rescued her, we had to break down the door. It was the dead of winter, and she was barely clothed and badly fed, covered in wounds and cowering under a rag on her uncle\u2019s balcony.\n\nLikewise, when we rescued 10-year-old Mohsin and 8-year-old Aslam in 2007, they were starving. The two children worked for their uncle making children\u2019s clothing for one of the world\u2019s largest garment retailers under terrible conditions. The jobs performed by Arpita, Mohsin and Aslam would not be considered \u201chazardous\u201d under the amendments to the Child Labour Act.\n\nIn a recent analysis, we found that one-fifth of the children younger than age 14 rescued by Bachpan Bachao Andolan were working for family businesses. More than 40 percent of the rescued children were performing hazardous jobs that would be allowed under the proposed changes. For example, the children worked in roadside restaurants or manufactured garments, leather goods, cosmetics or electronics.\n\nChanges In India's Law Opposed\n\nThere are millions of enslaved children like Arpita, Mohsin and Aslam. But if the proposed amendments are adopted, we will not be able to rescue a single child under 14 years of age who works for his or her \u201cfamily.\u201d It does not matter how terrible their work conditions are. The impact \u2013 not just on individual children, but also on the future of the society \u2013 would be devastating. On behalf of India\u2019s children, we call upon our Parliament to do the right thing and reject the proposed amendments to the Child Labour Act.\n\nBeyond India, the imperative to protect children is just as strong. If we are to realize the future promised in the SDGs, surely we must do everything in our power to protect the fundamental human rights of every person, especially the most vulnerable. Governments worldwide must deepen their commitment to child-friendly policies and protecting and educating of their young people.\n\nMy colleagues and I have humbly done our part over the years, rescuing more than 84,000 children from dreadful conditions. To those children and their families, it has meant everything.\n\nStill, far too many children remain enslaved. They are missing out not just on their childhood, but also on the chance for a happy, healthy and prosperous future. It is time for the world to stand up and lend its voice to those whose cannot speak for themselves. We must demand that our leaders fulfill their promise of ensuring that every child\u2019s life is free from exploitation, enriched by education and full of promise.

On the other hand, the proposed amendments to the Child Labour Act would erect new barriers to further progress on education.\n\nSpecifically, the changes to the Child Labour Act would allow children under the age of 14 to help their families in \u201cnon-hazardous\u201d family enterprises or the entertainment industry. This may sound innocuous, but it fails to acknowledge a stark and undisputable reality: Work for \u201cfamily enterprises\u201d can be as brutal as any other kind. And the list of \u201chazardous\u201d occupations is far from complete.\n\nBefore being rescued by my organization, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, 8-year-old Arpita was forced to work 16- to 18-hour days in the home of her uncle as domestic \u201chelp.\u201d When we rescued her, we had to break down the door. It was the dead of winter, and she was barely clothed and severely malnourished, covered in wounds and cowering under a rag on her uncle\u2019s balcony.\n\nLikewise, when we rescued 10-year-old Mohsin and 8-year-old Aslam in 2007 from a sweatshop \u2013 owned by their uncle \u2013 where they made children\u2019s clothing for one of world\u2019s largest garment retailers, they were starving. The jobs performed by Arpita, Mohsin and Aslam would not be considered \u201chazardous\u201d under the amended act.\n\nIn a recent analysis, we found that one-fifth of the children under age 14 rescued by Bachpan Bachao Andolan were working in family enterprises. More than 40% of the rescued children were performing hazardous jobs \u2013 for example, working in roadside restaurants (dhabas) or manufacturing garments, leather goods, cosmetics, or electronics \u2013 that would be allowed under the amended act.\n\nThere are millions of enslaved children like Arpita, Mohsin and Aslam. But if the proposed amendments are adopted, we will not be able to rescue a single child under 14 years of age who is employed by his or her \u201cfamily\u201d \u2013 no matter how vile the conditions of their servitude. The impact \u2013 not just on individual children, but also on the future of our society \u2013 will be devastating. On behalf of India\u2019s children, we call upon our Parliament to do the right thing and reject the proposed amendments to the Child Labour Act.\n\nBeyond India, the imperative to protect children is just as strong. If we are to realize the future promised in the SDGs, surely we must do everything in our power to protect the fundamental human rights of every person, especially the most vulnerable. That is why governments worldwide must deepen their commitment to pursuing child-friendly policies and investing in the protection and education of their young people.\n\nMy colleagues and I have humbly done our part over the years, rescuing more than 84,000 children from despicable conditions. It has not been enough to end the blight of child slavery, but to those children and their families, it has meant everything.\n\nStill, far too many children remain enslaved, missing out not just on their childhood, but also on the chance for a happy, healthy and prosperous future. It is time for the world to stand up and lend its voice to those whose cannot. We must demand that our leaders fulfill their promise of ensuring that every child\u2019s life is free from exploitation, enriched by education and full of promise. Our generation can and should be the one that ends child slavery forever.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "720L": "Opinion: World should be ashamed as millions of children are still slaves\nBy Kailash Satyarthi, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n02.03.16\n\nAzir Mulla, 14, sews inside a tailor's shop in Gauhati, India, Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2014.

In Beijing, shipping containers double as a community center. Photo: Jonathan Kaiman/Los Angeles Times/MCT\nLONDON, England \u2013 In the 1970s, the number of people in China was growing. The government got worried. Would there be enough food? It created a new rule that families could only have one child.\n\nThe rule was in effect for almost 40 years. This year, the rule has changed. Now, families can have as many as two children. The change will have big effects on the country. It will change the age balance in China, as well as the way people spend money.\n\nAn Age-Old Problem?\n\nThe one-child rule reduced the number of young people in China. For years, there was only one child for every two parents. Over time, old people started to outnumber young people.\n\nIn 1970, more than half of Chinese people were under the age of 20. In 2010, after years of the one-child rule, only about a quarter were under 20. Meanwhile, the share of people above the age of 60 doubled. Overall, the Chinese people got older.\n\nThis caused many problems. As old people get to the age when they stop working, they need young people for support. The problem is that there are not enough young people.\n\nWhere Is The ATM Machine?\n\nThe new two-child rule will help fix the age balance of the Chinese people, but it will take time. Children born this year will not start working for many years. In the meantime, things may actually get harder for some families. There will now be more very young people in China, and more old people. Middle-aged people will have to support them both.\n\nThe rule will also have good effects. It will\u00a0likely cause families to start spending more money. Right now, Chinese families save a lot of their money. While saving money can be wise, it can also be bad for businesses. Businesses do well when people spend their money rather than saving it.\n\nFamilies with two children will have to spend more money than families with just one child. After all, children are expensive. The two-child rule will mean that families have more children and spend more money. This will help Chinese businesses.\n\nToys, Bicycles, School Books\n\nSome businesses will feel the difference more than others. At first, the higher number of children will help the sales of children\u2019s books, toys, and bicycles. With time, more people will need homes and medicine. Other businesses will grow too.\n\nOne of the biggest effects of the new two-child rule will have to do with spending for school. In 2009, one-child families spent about a tenth of their money on school. Having a second child will mean that families spend even more on school.\n\nHelping A Country Grow\n\nOverall, families with two children will spend more money. However, that does not necessarily mean that children will get more from their parents. In two-children families, kids will have to share with their brothers and sisters.\u00a0Each child might get less.\n\nStill, China\u2019s shift to a two-child rule is expected to help the country in many ways. It will help to balance the number of young and the number of old people. It will also help businesses by making families spend more money.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: China\u2019s two-child consumption engine\nBy Keyu Jin, Project Syndicate\n01.22.16\n\nA migrant woman plays with her young child at a community center in Heiqiao Village, a dusty sprawl in suburban Beijing, China, Nov. 6, 2011. In Beijing, shipping containers double as a community center. Photo: Jonathan Kaiman/Los Angeles Times/MCT\nLONDON \u2013 The announcement in October that China is terminating its one-child policy marks the end of a 37-year historical aberration that has accelerated the country\u2019s demographic aging by decades. The social and economic consequences of the authorities\u2019 drastic population controls, which reduced the average fertility rate in urban households from about three in 1970 to just over one by 1982, have been dramatic. The question now is whether, and to what extent, the country\u2019s new two-child policy will mitigate those consequences.\n\nIn fact, the impact of the two-child policy is likely to be just as far-reaching \u2013 and, overall, much more positive \u2013 than that of the one-child rule. This is especially true in the long term, but the effects will become apparent even in the relatively shorter term. One key reason for this is that an increase in the number of children per household will force a reduction in the aggregate savings rate, fulfilling a long-standing macroeconomic goal.\n\nChina\u2019s current saving rate is so high that it is often blamed for fueling global imbalances and driving down interest rates worldwide. Moreover, it is a major obstacle in China\u2019s ongoing transition from an export-led growth model to one based on domestic consumption and services. The two-child policy may prove indispensable in propelling this transition \u2013 a process that will begin sooner than most observers anticipate.\n\nSo far, economists have focused largely on the impending shifts in China\u2019s demographic structure. Driven by the one-child policy, the share of China\u2019s population under the age of 20 fell from 51 percent in 1970 to 27% by 2010, while the share of people aged 60 and up rose from 7 percent to 14 percent. As a result, the median age increased from about 20 to 35.\n\nAs retirees increasingly outnumber working-age people, the pressure on today\u2019s younger generation will intensify. Indeed, in the coming years, each member of the post-1980s one-child generation will need to support two older people, on average.\n\nOf course, when the two-child generation becomes middle-aged, its members will each have to support only one elderly person, on average, alleviating the economic pressure associated with such a high old-age dependency ratio. But that will take a few decades. In the meantime, the post-1980s one-child generation will be supporting not only the elderly, but also a higher number of young people.\n\nAlthough this will undoubtedly be tough for the one-child generation, an unintended side effect will be a surge in consumption, as its members will have little choice but to spend a lot more. A comparison of families that had twins under the one-child policy and those that had just one child offers an indication of the scale of the change in consumption (though, of course, the inability of twins\u2019 parents to spread out consumption spending over time means that it is not a perfect representation).\n\nIn terms of saving, urban households with two children saved 12.8 percent of their incomes, on average, in 2009, compared to 21.3 percent in families with an only child. The difference is large across all income groups.\n\nThe child-fueled boost in household consumption will undoubtedly affect some sectors more than others. At first, the surge in the number of children will boost the performance of stocks in children\u2019s books, toys, and bicycles. As that generation ages, demand for housing, life insurance, and pharmaceuticals will increase substantially.\n\nOne of the biggest differences will be expenditure on education. According to the 2009 urban household survey, a one-child household in China spends an average of 10.6 percent of its total income on education, whereas a household with twins spends 17.3 percent. As the number of households with two children increases, this change alone could cause the aggregate saving rate in China to drop by as much as 7-10 percentage points, from 30 percent today to about 22 percent over the next 10 years.\n\nThere is, however, a caveat. More children also mean less education investment per child, which could lead to lower human-capital attainment. Indeed, the average twin receives far less support after age 15 than the average only child, creating large differences in education outcomes. Twins are 40 percent more likely to go to a vocational high school than only children.\n\nNonetheless, China\u2019s shift to a two-child policy is badly needed \u2013 and not just because it will achieve the intended long-term goal of balancing the country\u2019s demographic structure. While there are certainly pitfalls, including a difficult transition period, the policy could prove to be a boon to China\u2019s efforts to put its economy on a more stable long-term growth path.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "1160L": "Opinion: As China ends one-child rule, economists say more kids are alright\nBy Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n01.22.16\n\nA migrant woman plays with her young child at a community center in Heiqiao Village, a dusty sprawl in suburban Beijing, China, Nov. 6, 2011. In Beijing, shipping containers double as a community center. Photo: Jonathan Kaiman/Los Angeles Times/MCT\nLONDON, England \u2013 In the late 1970s, the Chinese government established a one-child policy in order to limit population growth. For almost four decades, families in China were only permitted to have one child. That policy has changed, now that lawmakers passed a law allowing families to have up to two children.\n\nAn Imbalanced Population\n\nThe social and economic consequences of the one-child policy have been dramatic. The rule reduced the average fertility rate for families living in cities from about three children per family in 1970 to just over one by 1982.\u00a0By limiting the number of newborns, the policy has resulted in an imbalanced population, with more old people than young people. \u00a0\n\nThe question now is whether the country\u2019s new policy will undo the effects of the one-child policy.\u00a0The consequences of the new two-children policy are likely to be just as dramatic, and much more positive.\n\nAn Economic Boost?\n\nThe greatest benefits of the two-child policy will take time to appear, but some effects will become apparent soon. One major effect has to do with family spending and the Chinese economy. The new policy will likely lead to an increase in the number of children per household, which in turn will cause families to spend more money. This will mean that less money in China is saved and more is spent, boosting the country's economy.\n\nCurrently, the amount of money that is saved in China is unusually high, which some people think has negative economic effects worldwide, because China buys few goods from other countries. Moreover, the fact that Chinese people save so much of their money is a major obstacle for the country's economy. It forces Chinese companies to focus on selling goods to other countries, rather than selling goods and services within the country. The two-child policy could change this if it causes families to start spending more.\n\nAging Population Gets Shot Of Youth\n\nThe two-child policy will also change the balance of China\u2019s aging population. In 1970, 51 percent of people were under the age of 20, but in 2010, thanks in part to the one-child policy, only 27\u00a0percent\u00a0were under 20. Meanwhile, the share of people aged 60 and up rose from 7\u00a0percent\u00a0to 14\u00a0percent.\n\nThis has put pressure on today\u2019s younger generation, because as more and more elderly people retire, there are not enough working people to support them. For years, parents in China could only have one child. As a result, each adult born under the one-child policy will have to support two parents, without any help from siblings.\u00a0\n\nBringing Balance To The Labor Force\n\nWhen the two-child generation becomes middle-aged, its members will each have to support only one elderly person, on average. This will restore some balance to China's population and economy. It will take a few decades, though, for children born under the new policy to start working. In the meantime, the post-1980s one-child generation will be supporting not only the elderly, but also a higher number of young people.\n\nAlthough this will undoubtedly be tough for the one-child generation, increased spending will have immediate positive effects on the economy. Families with two children will have little choice but to spend much more than families with only one child. Economists can estimate how big a difference a second child makes by looking at how much money families with twins spent in recent years.\n\nPiggy Banks To Slim Down?\n\nUnder the one-child law, some mothers ended up with two children instead of one when they gave birth to twins.\u00a0In 2009, families who\u00a0lived in cities and had twins\u00a0saved 13 percent\u00a0of their incomes, on average. In contrast, one-child families in cities saved an average of 21 percent\u00a0of their incomes. In other words, having a second child meant that the parents of twins saved less of their money and spent more of it.\n\nThe added spending will undoubtedly affect some parts of the economy more than others. At first, the surge in the number of children will mean higher sales of children\u2019s books, toys, and bicycles. As that generation ages, demand for housing, life insurance, and medications will increase substantially.\n\nPaying For School\n\nOne of the biggest impacts of the new policy will be spending on education. According to a 2009 survey of families living in cities, a one-child household in China spends an average of 11 percent\u00a0of its total income on education, whereas a household with twins spends 17 percent. As the number of households with two children increases, this change alone could increase spending significantly.\n\nThere is, however, a catch. Having more children also means that families are likely to spend less per child on education. Most Chinese families under the old policy focused all of their resources on a single child. Having two children forces families to divide their resources, so the new two-child policy may mean that kids will start growing up with less support from their parents, on average. Indeed, the average twin in China receives far less support after age 15 than the average only child, creating large differences in education outcomes.\n\nNonetheless, China\u2019s shift to a two-child policy is badly needed. Not only will it achieve the long-term goal of balancing the country\u2019s aging population, but it will also lead to increased spending, giving the economy a major boost.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "560L": "Opinion: China ends one-child rule; more children will help country grow\nBy Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n01.22.16\n\nA migrant woman plays with her young child at a community center in Heiqiao Village, a dusty sprawl in suburban Beijing, China, Nov. 6, 2011.

Families could only have one child.\u00a0\n\nChina is a large country in Asia. In the 1970s, the country was growing. Families were having lots of children. The government became worried that the country was going to get too crowded. Would there be enough food? The \"one-child\" rule was made to keep the number of people down.\u00a0\n\nYoung People Coming!\n\nThe rule caused many problems, though. This year, the rule has changed. Now, families can have two children.\u00a0\n\nThe rule will change the country in several ways. For one thing, there will soon be more young people in China.\n\nThe one-child rule reduced the number of young people in China. For years, there was only one child for every two parents. Over time, old people started to outnumber young people. The Chinese people, overall, got older.\n\nParents Will Spend More Money\n\nThis caused many problems. As people get old and stop working, they depend on young people. In China, there were not enough young people.\u00a0The new two-child\u00a0rule will help fix that. Eventually, it will make the ages of Chinese people more balanced.\n\nThe new rule will help in other ways, as well. It will\u00a0allow families to have two children instead of just one. As a result, it will probably cause many families to spend more money.\u00a0After all, it costs money to care for a child.\u00a0\n\nChildren Need Toys ... And Other Stuff Too\n\nRight now, Chinese families save a lot of their money. It would help China if people started spending more. More spending helps businesses. For example, car makers are happy when people spend more money buying cars.\n\nBusinesses will be happy with the new two-child rule.

Photo: Jonathan Kaiman/Los Angeles Times/MCT\nLONDON, England \u2013 For almost forty years, Chinese families were only allowed to have one child. This year, a new law went into effect allowing families to have up to two children. The change will have a big effect on the country's population, as well as the level of business activity.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the Chinese government established a one-child rule in order to limit the growth of the population. The effects of the law were significant. In 1970, before\u00a0the rule went into effect, families living in cities had about three children on average. In 1982, families had an average of just over one child.\n\nThis Is Getting Old\n\nBy limiting births to one per family, the rule reduced the number of young people in China. This threw off the population's balance, causing there to be more old people than young people.\n\nThe question now is whether the country\u2019s new two-child rule will undo the effects of the one-child rule. The Chinese government hopes that the new rule will help fix some of the country's problems.\n\nThe greatest benefits of the rule change will take time to appear. Some effects will become apparent more quickly. One\u00a0major effect has to do with family spending and Chinese businesses. The new rule will likely lead to an increase in the number of children per household, which in turn will cause families to spend more money. This would help Chinese businesses.\n\nToy Story\n\nCurrently, families in China save an unusually large amount of money. This forces many Chinese businesses to sell to other countries. The economy, or level of business activity and the availability of jobs, would improve if Chinese families started spending more and saving less, allowing businesses to sell more goods and services within China.\u00a0\n\nAs families\u00a0start having second children, they will have little choice but to spend more. After all, children are expensive.\u00a0The added spending will affect some businesses more than others. At first, the increase in the number of children will boost sales of children\u2019s books, toys, and bicycles. With time, demand for housing and medicine will increase too.\n\nThe two-child rule will also change the balance of China\u2019s aging population. The number of young people in China went down under the one-child rule. In 1970, more than half of the people were under the age of 20. By 2010, only about a quarter of the people were under 20. Meanwhile, the share of people above the age of 60 doubled during that time. Overall, the Chinese population has gotten older.\n\nUnder Pressure\n\nThis has put pressure on young people in China. A large portion of the population is elderly, and more and more elderly people retire each year. There are not enough working people to support them. The imbalance presents challenges for families. Most people\u00a0born under the one-child rule will have to support two parents without any help from siblings.\n\nWhen the two-child generation becomes middle-aged, its members will each have to support only one elderly person, on average, helping to fix some of the problems created by China's aging population. It will take many years, though, for these children to start working. In the meantime, things may actually get harder for some families. There will now be more very young people in China, balancing out the high number of old people. Middle-aged people will have to support them both.\n\nDon't Forget Your Homework\n\nOne of the biggest effects of the new two-child rule will have to do with education spending. According to a 2009 survey, a one-child family spends about a tenth of its income on education. Having a second child will increase that amount significantly.\u00a0\n\nThere is a catch, though.

Its size was not known when people first imagined we would go to the stars.\u00a0Tau Ceti, one of the closest stars to us at around 12 light-years away, is 100 billion times farther from Earth than our moon. We can\u2019t simply send people over such immense distances in a spaceship, because a spaceship is too impoverished an environment to support humans for the centuries it would take. Instead of a spaceship, we would have to create some kind of space-traveling ark. The ark would need to be big enough to support a community of humans and other plants and animals in a fully recycling ecological system.\n\nOn the other hand, it would have to be small enough to accelerate to a fairly high speed. A smaller ark would shorten the voyagers\u2019 time of exposure to radiation in space and to breakdowns in the ark.\u00a0The bigger the ark is, the proportionally more fuel it would have to carry along to slow itself down on reaching its destination. For that reason and others, smaller is better, but smallness creates problems for resource cycling and ecologic balance.\u00a0The design needs for bigness and smallness may cross each other, leaving any viable craft in an impossible middle.\n\n\"Space Ark\" Inhabitants Would Be Like Lab Animals\n\nAnother problem are the possible impacts on our microbiomes. About eighty percent of the DNA in our bodies is not human DNA, but the DNA of a vast array of smaller creatures known as microbes, which as a group together make up a microbiome system in our bodies. That array of living beings has to function in a balance for us to be healthy. The microbiome system co-evolved on Earth in a particular set of physical influences, including Earth\u2019s gravity, atmosphere, and chemical make-up. Traveling to the stars means leaving all these influences, and trying to replace them artificially with unknown consequences. Any ark would therefore be an experiment, its inhabitants lab animals. The first generation of the humans aboard might have volunteered to be experimental subjects, but their descendants would not have. These generations of descendants would be born into a set of rooms a trillion times smaller than Earth, with no chance of escape.\n\nRules would have to be enforced to keep all aspects of the experiment functioning. Reproduction would not be a matter of free choice, as the population in the ark would have to maintain minimum and maximum numbers. Many jobs would be required to keep the ark functioning, so work too would not be a matter of free choice. The ark's social structure would require the establishment of a strict state where everyone follows the rules.\n\nHistory has shown that people tend to react poorly in rigid states and social systems. Add to these social limitations permanent enclosure, exile from our planetary surface, and the probability of health problems, and the possibility for mental and emotional difficulties seems quite high. Over several generations, it\u2019s hard to imagine any such society staying stable.\n\nIt Could Take Centuries\n\nStill, humans are adaptable. It\u2019s conceivable that all the problems outlined so far might be solved, and that people enclosed in an ark might cross space successfully to a nearby planetary system. But if so, their problems will have just begun.\n\nAny planetary body the voyagers try to inhabit will be either alive or dead. If there is life, the problems of living in contact with an alien environment could range from harmless to fatal, but will surely require careful investigation. On the other hand, if the planetary body is dead, then the newcomers will have to transform it using only local resources and the power they have brought with them. The process will take centuries, during which time the ark, or its equivalent on the alien planet, would have to continue to function without failures.\n\nProblems On The Voyage, And Different Problems On Arrival\n\nSo, to conclude: an interstellar voyage would present one set of extremely difficult problems, and the arrival in another system, a different set of problems. All the problems together create not an outright impossibility, but a project of extreme difficulty, with very poor chances of success. The unavoidable uncertainties suggest that pursuing the project would require many preconditions before it was undertaken. First, there would need to be a sustainable human civilization on Earth itself to teach us many of the things we would need to know to construct a workable ark. Second, there\u00a0would need\u00a0to be a great deal of practice in an ark orbiting our sun, where we could\u00a0make repairs and study the ark. Third, there\u00a0would need\u00a0to be extensive robotic\u00a0explorations of nearby planetary systems, to see if any are suitable candidates for habitation.\n\nUnless all these steps are taken, humans cannot successfully travel to and inhabit other star systems.

Photo: NASA\nThe idea that humans will eventually travel to and inhabit other parts of our galaxy was well expressed by the early Russian rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who wrote, \u201cEarth is humanity\u2019s cradle, but you\u2019re not meant to stay in your cradle forever.\u201d Since then the idea has been a staple of science fiction, and thus become part of a consensus image of humanity\u2019s future. Going to the stars is often regarded as humanity\u2019s destiny, even a measure of its success as a species. But in the century since this vision was proposed, things we have learned about the universe and ourselves combine to suggest that moving out into the galaxy might not be humanity\u2019s destiny after all.\n\nThe problem that tends to underlie all the other problems with the idea is the sheer size of the universe, which was not known when people first imagined we would go to the stars. Tau Ceti, one of the closest stars to us at around 12 light-years away, is 100 billion times farther from Earth than our moon. A quantitative difference that large turns into a qualitative difference; we can\u2019t simply send people over such immense distances in a spaceship, because a spaceship is too impoverished an environment to support humans for the time it would take, which is on the order of centuries. Instead of a spaceship, we would have to create some kind of space-traveling ark, big enough to support a community of humans and other plants and animals in a fully recycling ecological system.\n\nOn the other hand it would have to be small enough to accelerate to a fairly high speed, to shorten the voyagers\u2019 time of exposure to cosmic radiation, and to breakdowns in the ark. Regarded from some angles bigger is better, but the bigger the ark is, the proportionally more fuel it would have to carry along to slow itself down on reaching its destination; this is a vicious circle that can\u2019t be squared. For that reason and others, smaller is better, but smallness creates problems for resource metabolic flow and ecologic balance. Island biogeography suggests the kinds of problems that would result from this miniaturization, but a space ark\u2019s isolation would be far more complete than that of any island on Earth. The design imperatives for bigness and smallness may cross each other, leaving any viable craft in a non-existent middle.\n\nThe biological problems that could result from the radical miniaturization, simplification and isolation of an ark, no matter what size it is, now must include possible impacts on our microbiomes. We are not autonomous units; about eighty percent of the DNA in our bodies is not human DNA, but the DNA of a vast array of smaller creatures. That array of living beings has to function in a dynamic balance for us to be healthy, and the entire complex system co-evolved on this planet\u2019s surface in a particular set of physical influences, including Earth\u2019s gravity, magnetic field, chemical make-up, atmosphere, insolation and bacterial load. Traveling to the stars means leaving all these influences, and trying to replace them artificially. What the viable parameters are on the replacements would be impossible to be sure of in advance, as the situation is too complex to model. Any starfaring ark would therefore be an experiment, its inhabitants lab animals. The first generation of the humans aboard might have volunteered to be experimental subjects, but their descendants would not have. These generations of descendants would be born into a set of rooms a trillion times smaller than Earth, with no chance of escape.\n\nIn this radically diminished environment, rules would have to be enforced to keep all aspects of the experiment functioning. Reproduction would not be a matter of free choice, as the population in the ark would have to maintain minimum and maximum numbers. Many jobs would be mandatory to keep the ark functioning, so work too would not be a matter of choices freely made. In the end, sharp constraints would force the social structure in the ark to enforce various norms and behaviors. The situation itself would require the establishment of something like a totalitarian state.\n\nOf course sociology and psychology are harder fields to make predictions in, as humans are highly adaptable. But history has shown that people tend to react poorly in rigid states and social systems. Add to these social constraints permanent enclosure, exile from the planetary surface we evolved on, and the probability of health problems, and the possibility for psychological difficulties and mental illnesses seems quite high. Over several generations, it\u2019s hard to imagine any such society staying stable.\n\nStill, humans are adaptable, and ingenious. It\u2019s conceivable that all the problems outlined so far might be solved, and that people enclosed in an ark might cross space successfully to a nearby planetary system. But if so, their problems will have just begun.\n\nAny planetary body the voyagers try to inhabit will be either alive or dead. If there is indigenous life, the problems of living in contact with an alien biology could range from innocuous to fatal, but will surely require careful investigation. On the other hand, if the planetary body is inert, then the newcomers will have to terraform it using only local resources and the power they have brought with them. This means the process will have a slow start, and take on the order of centuries, during which time the ark, or its equivalent on the alien planet, would have to continue to function without failures.\n\nIt\u2019s also quite possible the newcomers won\u2019t be able to tell whether the planet is alive or dead, as is true for us now with Mars. They would still face one problem or the other, but they would not know which one it was \u2013 a complication that could slow any choices or actions.\n\nSo, to conclude: an interstellar voyage would present one set of extremely difficult problems, and the arrival in another system, a different set of problems. All the problems together create not an outright impossibility, but a project of extreme difficulty, with very poor chances of success. The unavoidable uncertainties suggest that an ethical pursuit of the project would require many preconditions before it was undertaken. Among them are these: first, a demonstrably sustainable human civilization on Earth itself, the achievement of which would teach us many of the things we would need to know to construct a viable mesocosm in an ark; second, a great deal of practice in an ark orbiting our sun, where we could make repairs and study practices in an ongoing feedback loop, until we had in effect built a successful proof of concept; third, extensive robotic explorations of nearby planetary systems, to see if any are suitable candidates for habitation.\n\nUnless all these steps are taken, humans cannot successfully travel to and inhabit other star systems. The preparation itself is a multi-century project, and one that relies crucially on its first step succeeding, which is the creation of a sustainable long-term civilization on Earth.

If we are able to save future generations from illnesses through gene editing, we should use that tool to stop suffering. But we should set limits on how that technology is used. Photo: AP/Allison Joyce\nNEW YORK, N.Y. \u2013 Genes make us who we are, for good or bad. Made of a substance called DNA, each is responsible for a particular trait. Passed down from parent to child, they are responsible for everything from hair color to a tendency toward a particular disease. Our genetic makeup has been beyond our control. Yet scientists have long wondered: Could harmful genes be altered before they are passed down to the next generation, or while a baby is still in its mother's womb?\n\nThere should no longer be any doubt on that score. One day, perhaps very soon, humans will be genetically modified. A new tool -- called CRISPR -- is already being used to edit the genomes of insects and animals. A genome is simply the complete set of genes found in any particular living thing.\n\nCRISPR is essentially a very sharp molecular knife that allows scientists to remove and insert genes precisely and inexpensively. It is only a matter of time before it will be used to engineer our descendants -- eliminating many dangerous hereditary diseases in the process.\n\nTo be sure, this eventuality is being hotly debated. The main arguments against genetic modification of human embryos are that it would be unsafe and unfair and that modification would quickly go beyond efforts to reduce the occurrence of inherited illnesses. However, ultimately, none of these reasons is likely to be persuasive enough to stop the technology from being widely used.\n\nArguments Against Gene Editing Won't Stop Use\n\nSafety is clearly an important factor, but it is unlikely to be a decisive one. The new gene-editing techniques appear to be very accurate. Animal tests and experiments with human embryos that will not leave lab dishes seem to prove there is little risk involved in their application.\n\nLikewise, as important a concern as fairness may be, it has never held back the adoption of technology. Yes, the benefits of CRISPR are likely to be made available primarily through private, profit-seeking companies, giving the rich far better access to the technology than the poor. However, that fact is not likely to lead to a postponement -- much less a ban -- of gene editing.\n\nThe world is full of unjust differences between people. The rich send their kids to elite schools, while the poor hope their child's school buildings do not collapse while class is in session. And yet, as unfair as this may be, the rich are not waiting for a level playing field. Instead, they are making wide use of elite private education. The same process will play out with genetic engineering.\n\nA Slippery Slope Toward Eugenics\n\nThe critics\u2019 most worrisome argument is that opening the door to repairing genetic disorders will also leave the way open for eugenics. Rather than focusing on eliminating diseases, eugenics seeks to introduce desirable traits into the human population. The problem, of course, is who gets to decide which traits are desirable. Furthermore, it is not clear whether doctors should be in the business of performing medical procedures aimed simply at enhancement, rather than eliminating disease.\n\nNonetheless, the same technology that can be deployed to eliminate hereditary diseases can undoubtedly be used to try to build genetically enhanced children. Inevitably, some will seek to do just that.\n\nHowever, that is not enough of a reason to give up on the promise of genetic engineering. The world is plagued with hereditary diseases that cause very real misery: sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, type 1 diabetes, cystic fibrosis, mitochondrial diseases, polycystic kidney disease, Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, mucopolysaccharidoses, some forms of breast, prostate, and colon cancer, and the list goes on. It is absurd to think that genetic engineering will not be used to eliminate them.\n\nPressure from parents seeking to prevent their children and grandchildren from suffering will undoubtedly overwhelm concerns about the possibility that others will use the same technology to attempt to build superkids -- and rightly so. The sick should not be held hostage to worries about possible dangers or abuses.\n\nInstead, Let's Set Up Protections\n\nThere is no reason to waste time arguing about whether humans should be genetically engineered. As justifiable as some of the concerns may be, there are simply too many benefits to be gained from preventing hereditary diseases. Those seeking to limit genetic engineering to such efforts would be better off devoting their energies to explaining why eugenics is wrong. They should not attempt to stop the march of progress toward healing the sick and eliminating awful disorders.\n\nRather than arguing about whether CRISPR should be used in humans, we should\u00a0refocus the public debate on appropriate safeguards.\u00a0We should begin\u00a0determining who decides when\u00a0CRISPR\u00a0is safe enough to be deployed, and what counseling should be provided for parents considering its use. We should begin figuring out how to broaden access for the poor.\n\nThe more time we spend debating whether to adopt a technology that undoubtedly will be adopted, the less time we will have to consider more important issues. We need to know, for example, how to respond to the for-profit medical community's promise to give us taller, smarter, healthier, cuter, stronger, and more loving children.

Such alteration is known as gene editing.\n\nCRISPR allows scientists to remove and insert genes precisely. It is only a matter of time before it will be used to engineer our descendants. Many dangerous inherited diseases may soon be eliminated as a result.\n\nHuman Engineering Is Coming\n\nTo be sure, human genetic engineering is being hotly debated. The main arguments against it are that it would be unsafe and unfair and that it would quickly go beyond simply preventing inherited illnesses. However, in the end none of these reasons is likely to stop the technology from being widely used.\n\nFears about safety are probably unnecessary. The new gene-editing methods appear to be very accurate. All tests and experiments so far seem to prove there is little risk involved.\n\nFairness is certainly an important concern. The rich will probably have easier access to CRISPR than poorer families. However, that fact is not likely to lead to a ban on gene editing.\n\nAfter all, the world is full of unjust differences between people. The rich send their children to the best schools, while the poor are often forced to send their children to the worst. And yet, as unfair as this may be, the rich are not waiting for things to change. Instead, they are making wide use of the best private education money can buy. The same process will play out with genetic engineering, whether we like it or not.\n\nWill Gene Editing Lead To Eugenics?\n\nThe critics\u2019 most worrisome argument is\u00a0that\u00a0CRISPR will\u00a0open the door for eugenics. The goal of eugenics is to introduce desirable traits into the human population, the same way farmers breed cattle. The problem, of course, is who gets to decide which traits are desirable.\u00a0\n\nFurthermore, it is not clear whether doctors should use\u00a0CRISPR simply for\u00a0enhancement \u2014 for making children smarter, stronger or better looking. Perhaps\u00a0eliminating disease should be the only justification for\u00a0CRISPR.\n\nSuch concerns are understandable. However, those reasons are not compelling enough to give up on the promise of genetic engineering. The world is plagued with inherited diseases that cause very real misery: sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, type 1 diabetes, cystic fibrosis, mitochondrial diseases, polycystic kidney disease, Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, mucopolysaccharidoses, some forms of breast, prostate, and colon cancer, and the list goes on. It is absurd to think genetic engineering will not be used to get rid of such diseases when the ability to do so exists.\n\nFocus On Relieving Suffering\n\nIn the end, parents who want to keep their children and grandchildren from suffering will win out. Their needs will outweigh concerns over\u00a0CRISPR being used\u00a0to build superkids \u2014 and that is how it should be. The sick should not be left untreated due to worries about possible dangers or abuses.\n\nThere is no reason to waste time arguing about whether humans should be genetically engineered. As justifiable as some of the concerns may be, there are simply too many benefits to be gained from preventing inherited diseases.\u00a0\n\nWhat is more, those who want to limit genetic engineering to disease prevention\u00a0should not try to delay the use of\u00a0CRISPR. They should not ask us to wait until all possible problems have been worked out. Instead, they should\u00a0devote their energies to explaining why eugenics is wrong. They should not attempt to stop the march of progress toward healing the sick and eliminating awful disorders.\n\nNext Step: Setting Up Protections\n\nRather than arguing about whether CRISPR should be used in humans, we should\u00a0refocus the public debate on appropriate safeguards.\u00a0We should begin\u00a0determining who decides when\u00a0CRISPR\u00a0is safe enough to be used and what counseling should be provided for parents considering its use. We should begin figuring out how to make gene editing available to\u00a0the poor.\n\nThere is no doubt that human gene editing is coming.\u00a0Instead of wasting time arguing over whether or not to allow it, we should begin considering the serious issues it will raise. It will be here sooner or later whether we like it or not.\u00a0\n\nSoon enough, some doctors will begin focusing on using\u00a0CRISPR simply for enhancement. It can be done, and it will be.\u00a0We need to know how to respond to their promise to give us taller, smarter, healthier, cuter, stronger, and more loving children. We need to decide if such changes are worth making at all.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: Engineering the better baby\nBy Arthur Caplan, Project Syndicate\n01.20.16\n\nOur genes set the pattern for many aspects of our lives, from hair and skin color to our likelihood to contract certain diseases.

Photo: AP/Allison Joyce\nNEW YORK \u2013 There should no longer be any doubt about whether humans will one day be genetically modified. A new tool -- called CRISPR -- is already being used to edit the genomes of insects and animals. Essentially a very sharp molecular knife, CRISPR allows scientists to carve out and insert genes precisely and inexpensively. It is only a matter of time before it will be used to engineer our descendants -- eliminating many dangerous hereditary diseases in the process.\n\nTo be sure, this eventuality is being hotly debated. The main arguments against genetic modification of human embryos are that it would be unsafe and unfair and that modification would quickly go beyond efforts to reduce the incidence of inherited maladies. But, ultimately, none of these reasons is likely to be persuasive enough to stop the technology from being widely used.\n\nSafety is clearly an important factor, but it is unlikely to be a decisive one. The new gene-editing techniques appear to be very accurate. Animal tests and experiments with human embryos that will not leave lab dishes seem to be on track to prove that there is little risk involved in their application.\n\nLikewise, as valid an ethical concern as fairness may be, it has never held back the adoption of technology. Yes, the benefits of CRISPR are likely to be made available primarily through private, profit-seeking companies, giving the rich far better access to the technology than the poor. But that fact is not likely to lead to a moratorium \u2013 much less a ban \u2013 on gene editing.\n\nThe world is rife with disparities. The rich send their kids to elite schools, while the poor hope the building in which their child attends lessons does not collapse while class is in session. And yet, as unfair as this may be, the rich are not waiting for the playing field to be leveled; they are making wide use of elite private education. The same dynamic will play out with genetic engineering.\n\nThe critics\u2019 last argument -- that opening the door to repairing genetic disorders will also leave the way open for eugenics -- is the most worrying. The same technology that can be deployed to eliminate hereditary diseases can undoubtedly be used to try to build genetically enhanced children. And yet, as slippery as this slope might be, we will, sooner or later, find ourselves inching our way down it.\n\nThe world is plagued with hereditary diseases that cause very real misery: sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, type 1 diabetes, cystic fibrosis, mitochondrial diseases, polycystic kidney disease, Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, mucopolysaccharidoses, some forms of breast, prostate and colon cancer, and the list goes on. It is absurd to think that genetic engineering will not be used to eliminate them.\n\nPressure from parents seeking to prevent their children and grandchildren from suffering will undoubtedly overwhelm concerns about the possibility that others will use the same technology to attempt to build superkids -- and rightly so. The sick should not be held hostage to worries about possible dangers or abuses.\n\nThere is no reason to waste time arguing about whether humans should be genetically engineered. As justifiable as some of the ethical concerns may be, there are simply too many benefits to be gained from preventing hereditary diseases. Those seeking to limit genetic engineering to such efforts would be better off devoting their energies to explaining why eugenics is wrong, rather than attempting to stop the march of progress toward healing the sick and eliminating awful disorders.\n\nThe slope may indeed be slippery. That is why it is far more important to refocus the public debate on appropriate safeguards. Rather than arguing about whether CRISPR should be used in humans, we should be working to determine who decides when it is safe enough to be deployed, what counseling should be provided for parents considering its use, and how to broaden access for the poor.\n\nThe more time we spend debating whether to adopt a technology that undoubtedly will be adopted, the less we will have to consider more relevant issues. We need to know, for example, how to respond to the promise of taller, smarter, healthier, cuter, stronger, and more loving children before commercial providers begin rolling out their marketing campaigns.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "810L": "Opinion: We can engineer a better baby, but we should be careful\nBy Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n01.20.16\n\nOur genes set the pattern for many aspects of our lives, from hair and skin color to our likelihood to contract certain diseases.

Genes can also be responsible for serious physical problems.\u00a0\n\nGenes are inherited, or passed down from parent to child. That is why we look like our parents. Unfortunately, we also sometimes inherit harmful genes that make us more likely to become sick.\n\nScientists have long hoped to be able to change the genes in our bodies. If they could do that, they could stop a harmful gene from being passed down. Perhaps doctors could even remove harmful genes from a baby's body while it is still inside its mother's womb.\n\nThe day scientists have hoped for is almost here. Very soon they will be able to remove or change human genes. A new tool is already being used to change the genes of insects and animals. Removing, adding or changing genes is known as gene editing.\n\nA Promise To Help Stop Diseases\n\nThe new tool is called CRISPR. It allows scientists to remove and add genes cheaply and easily. It is only a matter of time before it will be used on humans. Soon, scientists may be able to get rid of many dangerous inherited diseases.\n\nStill, some people are worried about possible problems. They say human gene editing could be unsafe and might be used unfairly. They also worry that it will be used for much more than just getting rid of diseases.\u00a0\n\nNone of these fears will stop\u00a0CRISPR\u00a0from being widely used, however.\n\nFears about safety are probably unnecessary. All tests and experiments so far show there is little risk involved.\u00a0CRISPR seems to work well.\n\nFairness is certainly an important concern. Gene editing will probably be expensive, so the rich may be the ones using it. The poor may not be able to afford it.\u00a0\n\nHowever, that probably will not stop doctors from offering gene editing.\n\nFears About How Technology Will Be Used\n\nAfter all, the world is unfair in many ways. The rich send their kids to the best schools, while the poor are often forced to send their children to the worst. The same thing will probably happen with gene editing, whether we like it or not.\n\nThe most important fear is that gene editing will lead to eugenics. It is a science that tries to improve the human race by selecting the genes of future children. The goal of eugenics is not to make people well but to make them perfect. The problem is, who gets to decide what perfect is?\n\nMany people may want to pay doctors to make their children smarter, stronger or better looking. However, such unnecessary enhancement may not be the right thing to do. Perhaps doctors should only use CRISPR to stop people from becoming sick.\n\nIf We Have The Tool, We Should Use It\n\nSuch worries are understandable. However, they are not enough of a reason to block the use of\u00a0CRISPR.\u00a0There are so many terrible inherited diseases, and it is unreasonable not to get rid of them when it is possible to do so.\u00a0The sick should not be left untreated just because of fears that some parents will want to build superkids.\n\nIt is time to stop arguing about whether CRISPR should be used in humans. It will be, whether we like it or not. We should begin trying to make sure it will be used safely, and not only by the rich.\n\nWe should also get ready for the problems and questions gene editing will bring.\n\nSoon enough, doctors will start using\u00a0CRISPR simply for enhancement.

Why would they make fun of me for it?\n\nIn middle school, some of the players on other teams said mean things. They told me to go back to China. In college, people called me hurtful names. During one game, I began to feel rage. It made me play badly in an important game.\n\nA Better Player, A Better Person\n\nKenny Blakeney was my coach. He said people used my race to hurt me. When I became angry, they won. Blakeney is black. He also used to be bullied. He told me that it made him stronger.\n\nHe said I should not let the bullying bother me. Instead, I could use it to become a better basketball player and a better person. His story gave me hope. I cannot stop people from making fun of me. I can only choose how I feel about myself.\n\nBullies are cowards. They try to make themselves more important. They do this by pushing someone else down. You might think you should try to be like everyone else. Do not do it. Your differences are what make you special. Many famous people used to be bullied for being different.\n\nHelp Other People\n\nStand up for other people. Help them find someone to talk to. My coach made me feel less alone. It does not matter how old you are. You can help people feel safe to be themselves.\n\nI am very proud to be a Chinese-American in the NBA. I did not let the name-calling get to me. If I did, I would not be able to go to my dream job every day. I might have lost my temper or given up.\n\nNow, I feel grateful. I do what love. I love teaching other players about China. Most of all, I love encouraging young people. I tell them to be proud of their own differences.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "710L": "Opinion: Basketball's Jeremy Lin learned to ignore the bullies\nBy Jeremy Lin, adapted by Newsela staff\n01.19.16\n\nCharlotte Hornets guard Jeremy Lin (center) does a layup as Los Angeles Clippers forward Wesley Johnson (left), guard Pablo Prigioni (second from left) and center Cole Aldrich watch during the first half of an NBA basketball game in Los Angeles, California, Jan. 9, 2016.

Photo: Courtesy of Jeremy Lin\nPeople ask me about bullying and are often surprised when I tell them that I was teased on the basketball court.\n\nGrowing up, it was not very common for an Asian-American to be spending so much time playing basketball. On many of the teams I played for, I was either the only or one of very few Asian-Americans. This made me an easy target. Unfortunately, I was often mocked.\n\nIn middle school, some of the players on other teams called me a \u201cChinese import.\u201d They also told me to \u201cgo back to China.\u201d When I started playing basketball in college it became even more open. During some of our games, people called me hurtful names. They made fun of me by chanting Asian foods like \u201cshrimp fried rice.\u201d\n\nA Proud Chinese Heritage\n\nI am proud that my family came from China. I felt furious that they would use my race to try to embarrass or hurt me. During one game, it got to me so much that I became angry while playing. My emotions led me to play badly in an important game.\n\nOne of my coaches at the time was named Kenny Blakeney. He noticed that my game had suffered and told me that when people use racial insults, they\u2019re trying to upset me. When I become angry and lose control, they have succeeded.\n\nBlakeney is black. He told me about his own experience of being bullied. I was shocked at what he had gone through. He told me that I could let the bullying get to me. I could also use it to become a better basketball player and a better human being. His story gave me hope and encouragement. Instead of letting his experience make him angry and bitter, it made him stronger. Maybe I couldn\u2019t control what people said to me, but I could choose how I felt about myself.\n\nBullies Try To Rise Up By Pushing Others Down\n\nBullies try to raise themselves up by pushing someone else down. They might try to find something that is different about you. They might use your differences against you. But your differences are what make you special.\n\nWhen you get bullied, you might want to become like everyone. Do not do it. Hold on to what makes you special. It might be what makes you an artist or a scientist some day. You can help others who feel the same way you do. You would be surprised how many people you admire now were once bullied for being different.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t being bullied right now, stand up for other people. They might be teased because they do not look or act like everyone else. Speak up for them. Also help them find someone who they can talk to. My coach made me feel less alone and helped me remember not to let it get to me. No matter how old you are, you can help people feel safe to be themselves.\n\nGrateful For What I Do\n\nI am extremely proud to be an Asian-American in the NBA. If I had let the name-calling get to me, I would not be able to go to my dream job every day. I play for the Charlotte Hornets. If Coach Blakeney had not encouraged me, I might have continued to lose my temper. I also might have given up.\n\nNow, I\u2019m grateful to do what I love.

On Wednesday, they won $1.6 billion.\n\nTwo days before that, a person posted a meme about Powerball on Facebook. A meme is a picture with a message that spreads through the Internet. The meme said the lottery could solve poverty.\n\n\n\nGetting The Math Wrong\n\n\"Powerball 1.3 billion \u00f7 U.S. pop 300 million,\" the meme reads. \"Everyone receives 4.33 mil. Poverty solved!!\" The meme was made on Monday. Then, the jackpot was $1.3 billion before the amount went higher.\n\nThe meme is incorrect because $1.3 billion divided by 300 million is\u00a0$4.33. That amount of money is not enough to help anyone. Also, the United States population was 308.7 million in 2010.\u00a0\n\nStill, the meme became very popular. Hundreds of thousands\u00a0liked it. Some people made fun of the meme's bad math, though. Others, however, agreed with the person who made the meme. His name is\u00a0Philipe Andolini. His point is that there is\u00a0enough money to solve poverty.\n\nImportant Questions\n\nThe meme was not really about the lottery. It asks important questions. How can one person win so much money? Why do other people have almost nothing?\n\nThere is some good news. Powerball does sort of give money back to people in America.\n\nPowerball is run by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL). Powerball tickets cost $2. When you buy a ticket, about $1 goes to prize money. Less than a dime pays to run the lottery. About 12 or 14 cents pays stores that sold tickets.\n\nCould Some Lottery Money Help The Poor?\n\nWhat happens to the rest? The money goes straight back to the state where you bought your ticket. The state government decides what to do with it. Different states spend the money in different ways.\n\nKentucky spent $30 million on reading programs for children. Pennsylvania spent $25 million on programs for old people. In Washington state, the money helped build a baseball field.\n\nAndolini's meme seems to make a point. He says that more Powerball money should help the poor.\u00a0His math was wrong.

Poverty solved!!\"\n\nAlas: Not really! As smug gentlemen and scholars have pointed out across the Internet, $1.3 billion divided by 300 million is actually a paltry $4.33. (Also, not to nitpick here, but the U.S. population was 308.7 million as of the 2010 census - and only 234.6 million, if you exclude children under age 18.)\n\nSo: Why have 1.3 million people reshared the meme on Facebook, and why have hundreds of thousands liked it? Some are doubtlessly mocking the meme's bad math - but others, I suspect, agree strongly with the general philosophy of Philipe Andolini, the man to whom it's credited.\n\nHis \"math was incorrect but I get it,\" wrote Livesosa, the rapper whose post made the meme go viral. \"Point (he) was attempting to make it simple. There's enough money to feed the people.\"\n\nIn other words, this is a meme less about Powerball and more about distribution: How is it - Andolini's presumably arguing - that one person can, in a stroke of unthinkable fortune, win $1.3 billion ... when other people have next to nothing? Isn't there some way to distribute Powerball's proceeds a little more equitably?\n\nThis is, of course, not a policy or economics blog, so we won't delve into the political aspects of that question. But we can present some good news, for Andolini and others: namely, that Powerball does sort of redistribute money back to \"the people\" ... albeit not in the form of 300 million personal checks, and not in any form even approaching perfectly equitable. (Case in point: Low-income people are the biggest players of the lottery, leading many economists to argue that it's a \"regressive tax\" on the poor.)\n\nPowerball is run by the Multi-State Lottery Association, a nonprofit based in Iowa, that basically operates several monster games across 36 states and Washington, D.C. When you buy a Powerball ticket, roughly 50 to 65 percent of your $2 - depending where you are - goes to the pot of prize money. A small portion, less than a dime, goes to administering the lottery. Something like 12 or 14 cents also goes to the retailer that sold the ticket.\n\nBut the rest? That goes straight back to the state where you bought your ticket, and your state government decides what to do with it. This varies wildly by state, of course, but the MUSL tracks how much lottery money has, cumulatively, gone to different causes in different states.\n\nIn Arizona, for instance, some $625 million has gone to local transportation funds since 1982. In Indiana, $637 million has gone to teachers' retirement; in Washington state, the lottery has helped build\u00a0CenturyLink\u00a0Field and the Seattle Mariners' stadium.\n\nAt its heart, Antolini's meme seems to argue that more Powerball money should go to programs that directly address and alleviate poverty - things like literacy and early childhood reading programs (to which Kentucky's devoted $30 million) or meals and transportation for low-income seniors (as in Pennsylvania, nearly $25 billion.) His meme argues that the Powerball pot should be spent more responsibly, not less. And while his method and math are undeniably wrong, reforms to state lotto revenue distribution make lots of sense.\n\nAdmittedly, that doesn't read quite as well as a Facebook meme.\n\nUPDATE: The lottery rose to $1.6 billion and the winning numbers were picked on Wednesday, Jan. 13.\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "700L": "Opinion: Powerball cannot solve poverty but it gives money to states\nBy Washington Post, adapted by Newsela staff\n01.19.16\n\nA sign for the Powerball jackpot is seen at the Sunnybrook Tavern and Liquor Store in Fort Washington, Maryland, Jan. 13, 2016.

It is in charge of several huge lottery games in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Powerball tickets cost $2. So, when you buy a ticket, about $1 goes to prize money. Less than a dime pays to run the lottery. About 12 or 14 cents goes to the store that sold the ticket.\n\nWhat happens to the rest? The money goes straight back to the state where you bought your ticket. Your state government decides what to do with it.

Photo: AP/Robert Jordan\nPARIS, France \u2014 The Industrial Revolution changed the world. The Revolution took place in the 1700s and 1800s and was a time when many important technological advances were made. It made it easier for everyone to benefit from new inventions and ideas. However, even though technology became more common, many people did not have the training to use it. Technology sped up, but not enough people could get a good education. Since then, leaders have been trying to figure out how to make sure everyone gets a good education.\u00a0\n\nOne solution is through universal access to education. With universal access to education, everyone has the opportunity to go to school. It took about a hundred years for the idea of universal access to schooling to spread to countries around the world. People in today's world are much more educated than they were hundreds of years ago. Even though many more kids have access to school than they used to, there is more work to be done. Lawmakers and leaders must make sure that everyone can get high-quality education.\n\nEducation Can Lead To Better Lives\n\nThe world is no longer as divided as it used to be. There used to be a clear division between rich, well-educated countries and poor, badly educated ones. Education can help bridge these differences. When countries spend money to improve the quality of their education system, their people's lives improve.\n\nYet even in rich countries, the quality of education needs to be improved.\u00a0\n\nThe quality of a nation's education system is important. Education can affect a nation's economy in different ways. An economy is the amount of wealth and jobs a country has. In fact, education is a part of the human development index. The index uses several factors to rank countries. It measures the quality of life of the people who live around the world. The index shows that being able to read leads to better lives. For example, adults who cannot read face challenges that literate people do not. Adults with low literacy skills are far more likely to have health problems. They also trust other people less and feel less in control of their lives.\n\nStudents Must Be Prepared For Jobs\n\nIt is not just enough to make sure that everyone goes to school. It is just as important to teach students the skills they actually need. Countries must make sure that their schools prepare students for jobs.\n\nToday, knowledge is still important. But it is easy for anyone to find information on the Internet. So, it is the students who know how to use that information who succeed in the workforce.\n\nSchools must also teach students how to see patterns among different pieces of information. Successful countries train students to be curious and to ask questions. Educators should inspire their students to make connections between different ideas.\u00a0\n\nLearning Teamwork Is Important\n\nAnother important factor is teamwork. Workers today must be able to get along with others and work together. Big ideas today rarely come from people working alone. Instead, new ideas come from sharing and working together. Schools should give students the opportunity to connect with other students and learn about how to deal with different opinions.\u00a0\n\nAs lawmakers think about improving today's schools, they should focus on jobs. While grades are important, so is being able to succeed in the workforce. Teachers can help prepare their students for life after school, too. One way to do that is to provide students services that make it easier to find and keep jobs. Educators should also teach skills that are useful in work, like teamwork and communication.\u00a0\n\nAs technology changes around us, the education system must change, too. It will not be easy to fix the education system. Nevertheless, it is an important goal. Governments, teachers and businesses will all need to pitch in.\u00a0\n\nIn the end, the future of education depends on students. Individuals must also step up. Students need to take advantage of opportunities to build their own futures.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "530L": "Opinion: The world is changing fast, so schools must change, too\nBy Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n01.12.16\n\nLowndes County Middle School students (from left) Lauren Starks, Antonio Davis, Caitlyn Gilkey and Ashley Starks watch as University of Mississippi doctoral candidate Murrell Godfrey dilutes salt water with tap water, causing an uncooked egg to sink during a chemistry magic show in Coulter Hall on the university's campus, April 24, 2003. Photo: AP/Robert Jordan\nPARIS, France \u2014 The world is changing fast. Technology is a big part of that. Technology makes life easier for most people. However, not everyone around the world knows how to use these tools, like computers. The world's education system needs to improve. Everyone should have the training to use technology. \u00a0\n\nSome countries offer a good education. Yet that is not the case everywhere. In some countries, kids cannot go to school or the schools are not good. This needs to change. All kids, no matter where they live, should be able to go to a good school.\u00a0\n\nEducation is very important. It helps people have better lives. It also helps countries become richer. The world used to be more divided. There were just rich countries and poor countries. Now, education has improved. Some poorer countries have improved their education. When people are educated, it is easier for countries to work together and for them to buy things from one another.\u00a0\n\nEducation Makes Lives Better\n\nEducation can change a country's economy. The economy is how a country makes money and spends it. Countries with good education systems have better economies. More jobs can be found. When a country educates its people, the people are healthier. They have longer lives.\u00a0\n\nIt is important that everyone can go to a good school. However, it is also important that schools teach kids the right things.\u00a0\n\nOne key skill is how to think. Today, it is easy to find information on the Internet. Schools should teach students about what to do with the information they find.\n\nTeamwork, Listening Are Important\n\nTeamwork is also important. Schools should help students to learn to work with one another. Having these skills is important at jobs today. Everyone has different opinions. People do not always agree with one another. Successful adults know how to listen to different opinions. Listening to ideas and working together are important skills.\u00a0\n\nThe main goal of education should be to get a job. There are certain skills students need to get jobs. Teachers play a big role in teaching those skills. Teachers can help students learn how to communicate and work together.

These advances were reserved for the wealthy. But as technological progress accelerated, education failed to keep pace. This left large numbers of people without the intellectual tools needed to adapt to a rapidly changing world. It also, on a larger scale, contributed to widespread suffering.\n\nIt took a century for public policy to respond with an effort to provide universal access to schooling to ensure that everyone would have access to education. In recent decades, big strides have been made in achieving that ambitious goal worldwide. But there is more to be done. We live in an era when technological innovation is once again outpacing education. The effort to provide everybody with an opportunity to learn must not only be redoubled; it must also be retooled for an increasingly unstable and volatile world.\n\nAccess to education has been significantly broadened. The world is no longer as divided between rich, well-educated countries and poor, badly educated ones as it was once. The quality of schooling remains a powerful predictor of national income over the long term. In fact, many low-income countries have begun leveraging education as a tool toward strengthening their economies.\n\nEven Rich Countries Need To Help Students\n\nBut work remains in bringing education to everyone\u00a0\u2014\u00a0even in high-income countries. Many oil-producing countries, in particular, have succeeded in converting their economic wealth into physical capital and consumption, such as modern buildings and advanced transportation systems. But they have failed to invest in the human capital that will keep their economies running in the future. If high-income countries invested in educating all of their students with at least very basic skills, the countries would benefit greatly economically. Even with their abundant natural resources, far greater wealth lies untapped in the undeveloped skills of their people. \u00a0\n\nEducation has a much wider impact than simply improving a country's earnings or employment opportunities. That is one reason why education is a factor of the human development index. The index uses a mathematical algorithm to rank countries. According to the index, adults with lower literacy skills are far more likely to report poor health, have less trust in other people, and feel less like they can influence the politics of their country. For countries that fail to educate their residents with the proper skills, technological progress is unlikely to lead to economic growth, and large swaths of the population risk being left with no way to contribute to society.\n\nSkills Should Match Available Jobs\n\nAnd yet, it is important to note that formal education alone is not enough to ensure greater opportunity and prosperity. One important issue is matching skills to opportunities. In many economies, a large number of employers cannot find skilled workers while at the same time many unemployed graduates are looking for work. If individuals and countries want to continue to reap the benefits of education, policymakers must ensure that the education system trains students in the skills necessary to prosper in a rapidly changing world and ultimately get a job.\n\nIn the past, education was about imparting knowledge, but today, it is about providing students with the tools to navigate an uncertain, volatile world. Unfortunately, the skills that are easiest to teach and test, such as entering data or memorizing facts, are also the easiest to automate or outsource. State-of-the-art knowledge remains more important than ever. But the global economy has evolved into a knowledge economy. Today's world no longer rewards workers for what they know (Google knows everything); it rewards them for what they can do with what they know.\n\nTeaching Students How To Think\n\nEducation needs to focus on improving how students think and also on providing the social and emotional skills students need to successfully collaborate with others. In the past, educators taught students by breaking problems into manageable pieces and then teaching techniques to solve them. But in the workplace today, there is value to being able to look at many separate bits of information and put them together. Workers need more than technical skills. They must also have curiosity, open-mindedness and the ability to make connections between seemingly unrelated ideas.\n\nIn the traditional education system, students typically learn on their own and are judged individually. But as technology progresses and economies become more connected, \u00a0the ability to work with others is becoming increasingly important. Today, innovation and big ideas rarely result from individuals working in isolation. Instead, they are the product of sharing and collaboration. Schools need to add these skills into their class programs by giving students a chance to work across cultures.\n\nLinks Between School And Work\n\nPart of the solution is to promote learning that gives students skills they will use throughout their working lives, rather than focusing on education that ends when work begins. Learning and working can be better integrated, and this shift would allow young people to develop both work skills and \"soft skills\"\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including teamwork, communication,\u00a0and\u00a0negotiation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0through real-world experience. Another important policy\u00a0approach is to create pathways between the schools and the job market, including counseling, job-search assistance, incentives for companies to hire low-skilled youth, and income support for young people actively searching for work.\n\nTransforming education for the modern economy will require every part of society to rethink its role in students' lives. Governments will have to design smarter financial incentives. Education systems will have to start inspiring entrepreneurship and better job training. Employers will have to invest in training their workforces, and labor unions that represent workers will need to make sure that training leads to better job opportunities.\u00a0\n\nEducation is increasingly a global system, and this must be reflected in the skills it provides to graduates. Ultimately, however, the future of education will depend on individuals and their willingness to take advantage of learning opportunities and invest in their own futures.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: Education in an uncertain world\nBy Andreas Schleicher, Project Syndicate\n01.12.16\n\nLowndes County Middle School students (from left) Lauren Starks, Antonio Davis, Caitlyn Gilkey and Ashley Starks watch as University of Mississippi doctoral candidate Murrell Godfrey dilutes salt water with tap water, causing an uncooked egg to sink during a chemistry magic show in Coulter Hall on the university's campus, April 24, 2003.

But as technological progress accelerated, education failed to keep pace, leaving vast numbers of people struggling to adapt to a rapidly changing world and contributing to widespread suffering.\n\nIt took a century for public policy to respond with an effort to provide universal access to schooling. In recent decades, remarkable strides have been made toward realizing that ambition worldwide. But in an era when technological innovation is once again outpacing education, the effort to provide everybody with an opportunity to learn must not only be redoubled; it must also be retooled for an increasingly unstable and volatile world.\n\nAccess to education has been significantly broadened. The world is no longer rigidly divided between rich, well-educated countries and poor, badly educated ones. The quality of schooling remains a powerful predictor of national income over the long term, and many low-income countries have begun leveraging education in the service of economic development. As a result, among 80 countries with comparable data on the quality of learning, GDP per capita now explains only 6% of the variation in performance.\n\nMuch work remains to be done \u2014 even in high-income countries. Many oil-producing countries, in particular, have succeeded in converting their natural wealth into physical capital and consumption; but they have failed to build the human capital that can sustain their economies in the future. If the high-income non-OECD countries equipped their students at least with very basic skills, they would, as a group, benefit from added economic value equivalent to almost five times their current GDP. Even with their abundant natural resources, far greater wealth lies untapped in their populations\u2019 undeveloped skills.\n\nEducation has a much wider impact than simply improving earnings or employment opportunities, which is why it is a component of the human development index. In all countries with comparable data, adults with lower literacy skills are far more likely to report poor health, have less trust in their fellow citizens, and perceive themselves as objects \u2014 rather than actors \u2014 in the political process. For countries that fail to equip their residents with the proper skills, technological progress is unlikely to translate into economic growth, and large swaths of the population risk languishing on the margins of society.\n\nAnd yet, it is important to note that formal education alone is not enough to ensure greater opportunity and prosperity. In many economies, too many unemployed graduates coexist with a large number of employers who cannot find workers with the skills they need.

But the global economy no longer rewards workers for what they know (Google knows everything); it rewards them for what they can do with what they know.\n\nEducation needs to focus on improving how students think, work, and embrace technology, and on providing the social and emotional skills needed to collaborate with others. In the past, educators imparted knowledge by breaking problems into manageable pieces and then teaching techniques to solve them. Today, value is often created by synthesizing disparate bits of information. And for that, workers need more than technical knowledge; they must be imbued with curiosity, open-mindedness, and the ability to make connections between seemingly unrelated ideas.\n\nIn the traditional education system, students typically learned on their own and were judged individually. But as technology progresses and once-separate economies become interdependent, working with others is becoming increasingly important. Today, innovation rarely results from individuals working in isolation; far more often than not, it is the product of sharing and collaboration. Schools need to incorporate this new reality into their curriculums, preparing their students to work across cultures and equipping them for a world shaped by issues that transcend national boundaries.\n\nPart of the policy answer is promoting skills-oriented learning throughout workers\u2019 lives, rather than focusing on education that ends when work begins. Developing skills is easier when learning is integrated into the workplace. Doing so also allows young people to develop hard skills on modern equipment and learn soft skills \u2014 including teamwork, communication, and negotiation \u2014 through real-world experience. Another important policy approach is active intervention in the labor market, including counseling, job-search assistance, hiring subsidies for youths with low skills, and income support for young people actively searching for work.\n\nRetooling education for the modern economy will require the involvement of every sector of society. Governments will have to design smarter financial incentives. Education systems will have to pivot to foster entrepreneurship and offer better vocational training. Employers will have to invest in their workforces. And labor unions can contribute to ensuring that training translates into better jobs.\n\nEducation is increasingly a collective enterprise, and this must be reflected in the skills it provides to graduates.

It was mostly the wealthy who benefited from education and new inventions. But the Revolution changed society. It allowed everyone to use and experience new tools. However, the education system failed to keep up, which left many people without the training needed to adapt to the new world. Technology sped up, but access to education slowed down.\u00a0\n\nIt took about a hundred years for the idea of universal access to schooling to catch on. With universal access, everyone is entitled to an education. And in the last few decades, big strides have been made in achieving that ambitious goal around the world. Still, there is more to be done. Once again, technology is outpacing education. Lawmakers and education leaders must refocus on providing everyone with the opportunity to learn and must ensure that the education system is preparing students for the workforce.\u00a0\n\nOver the years, more and more people around the world have gained access to an education. The world is no longer as divided between rich, well-educated countries and poor, badly educated ones as it was once. The quality of schooling can cause a country to be rich or poor over the long term. In fact, many low-income countries have started to spend more money on education as a tool to improve their economies and create new jobs and businesses.\u00a0\n\nCountries Should Invest In People\n\nBut work remains in bringing education to everyone\u00a0\u2014\u00a0even in high-income countries. Some wealthy countries have succeeded in using their wealth to build roads and buildings and create things for people to buy. While they are flourishing in that regard, these countries have focused less on building up the skills of their people. They are not building a strong education system. These countries might be even richer if they tried to develop the skills and abilities of their people.\n\nThe quality of a nation's education system can have a wide effect on its economy, the system of buying and selling goods and creating jobs. In fact, education is a factor of the human development index. The index uses different factors to rank countries. According to the index, the ability to read contributes to the quality of life. Adults with lower literacy skills are far more likely to report poor health, have less trust in others, and not feel like they influence politics. For countries that fail to equip their residents with the proper skills, technological progress is unlikely to lead to a growing economy. Uneducated citizens are less likely to be able to contribute to their countries.\n\nGraduates Must Be Ready For Jobs\n\nIt is not enough just to make sure that everyone has access to school. It is just as important to teach students the skills they actually need. In many economies, graduates struggle to find jobs. At the same time, employers are looking for candidates to fill empty jobs at their companies. The graduates are educated, but do not have the skills companies need. Lawmakers must make sure that the education system trains students with the skills they need to thrive in a rapidly changing world and ultimately get a job.\n\nIn the past, education was about gaining knowledge but today, it is about providing students with tools. Economies reward workers for what they can do with what they know. Since services like Google make it easy to find information, successful people must know how to use this information.\n\nEducators used to teach students by breaking problems into smaller pieces and then giving techniques to solve them. But in the workplace today, workers often must take many separate bits of information and see patterns among them. Valuable workers are also curious and open-minded, and have the ability to make connections between seemingly unrelated ideas.\n\nAbility To Work With Others Is Important\n\nThe ability to work with others is also becoming increasingly important. Today, new products and big ideas rarely come from individuals working on their own. Instead, they usually come from sharing and working together. School programs need to inspire students to work with one another and be open to new options.\u00a0\n\nOne way to make the education system better around the world is to focus on what happens after school. Teachers should prepare kids to succeed in the workforce, not just in the classroom. This would help students develop professional skills and \"soft skills\" such as teamwork, communication and negotiation. There are also ways to better connect classrooms and jobs so students can make the move into the working world more easily. Policies that could help include counseling, job-search assistance, money for companies to hire youths with low skills, and income support for young people actively searching for work.\n\nTransforming education for the modern economy is an ambitious goal. Governments will have to design smart ways of providing money so that businesses and schools will be willing to help fix education. Education systems will have to start inspiring entrepreneurship and better job training. Employers will have to invest money in training their workforces.\u00a0\n\nEducation is increasingly a global system. As technology changes around us, education and curriculum must adapt quickly. Ultimately, however, the future of education depends on students. In order to transform our world, individuals must be willing to take advantage of learning opportunities and build their own futures.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In"}, {"1200L": "PRO/CON: Hot dog vs. hot planet\nBy Tribune News Service, adapted by Newsela staff\n01.11.16\n\nSouth Korean animal rights activists wearing livestock masks stage a rally for farm animals slaughtered due to foot-and-mouth disease and bird flu, encouraging people to be vegetarians, Seoul, South Korea, Feb. 6, 2011. Photo: AP/ Lee Jin-man\nPRO: To help stop global warming, we have to eat less meat\nMeat consumption around the world has been\u00a0rapidly increasing.\u00a0Unless this trend is reversed, grazing livestock will continue to release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and further damage the environment.\n\nGreenhouse gases, which also come from the burning of fossil fuels, build up in the atmosphere once they are emitted. They trap heat and, over time, have caused a sharp rise in average global temperatures. Known as global warming or climate change, this increase has had serious ecological effects, such as rising sea levels, disrupted weather patterns and more water shortages.\n\nOne way Americans can help reduce the buildup of greenhouse gases is by changing their eating habits. The major players in the livestock industry describe beef, lamb, chicken and pork\u00a0as healthy food choices. They are not.\n\nLivestock production currently accounts for significant greenhouse gas emissions worldwide and the situation is not getting any better. Deforestation to produce more grazing lands also contributes to the growing ecological crisis.\u00a0\n\n\"Livestock's Long Shadow\"\n\nThe big livestock companies have mounted an aggressively deceptive campaign against their critics.\n\nThey have even gone so far as to suggest, using junk science pushed by climate change deniers, that vegetarians contribute more to greenhouse gas emissions than meat eaters. Nothing could be more absurd.\n\nIn 2006 the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization released a groundbreaking report, titled \u201cLivestock\u2019s Long Shadow.\u201d It concluded that 18 percent of annual global greenhouse gas emissions were caused by cattle, sheep, buffalo, pigs and poultry.\n\nMore recent scientific studies have raised to a whopping 51 percent the percentage of greenhouse gases being emitted by livestock. It is an amazing fact that livestock produce more greenhouse gases than all the cars, trucks, airplanes, trains and ships in the world combined.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also sounded the alarm bell over the production of methane gas by livestock. The EPA has stated that methane emissions resulting from the digestive systems of livestock, a process known as enteric fermentation, represents a third of all emissions associated with U.S. agriculture.\n\nAdding to the problem of methane emissions is improper manure handling procedures on the part of the livestock industry. In order to save money, massive industrial farms and ranches expose manure storage areas to oxygen and moisture, which contributes to methane levels in the atmosphere.\n\nNo one championing an environmentally sound livestock industry is calling for a ban on Big Macs or porterhouse steaks. However, there is a need for an overall reduction in the consumption of meat products by the United States and other economically advanced nations.\n\nA Growing Problem\n\nNow that consumers in China and India are able to afford meat products, global demand has skyrocketed. So have the adverse effects on the environment. Increased demand for feed grain has also contributed to global climate change.\n\nReducing meat consumption must be part of an overall strategy for \u201cclean\u201d farming. Feeding practices, animal husbandry techniques and livestock health management must all be improved to make them less environmentally destructive.\u00a0In addition, there is a pressing need for a system that can transform\u00a0livestock waste into clean energy.\u00a0\n\nMedical experts agree that reducing meat consumption also benefits one\u2019s health.\n\nWhether a person opts to be a vegetarian or a carnivore is a personal choice, however. Proposals by governments to impose meat and dairy taxes to offset the cost of environmental damage and public health problems go too far. Governments should not try to dictate what people eat.\n\nWhen it comes to the livestock industry and the environment, it is a far better strategy to stick to the basic problem of greenhouse gas emissions. There is no need to add medical concerns to the debate.\n\nThe big livestock companies scoff at the notion of a link between their industry and climate change. However, consider a study conducted by the respected medical journal Lancet. It found that a reduction in meat consumption of just a half cup a day can significantly reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions.\n\nWe can all afford to make that easy sacrifice and our environment will be better off for it.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: The newly elected president of the Tampa Bay Press Club, Wayne Madsen is a progressive commentator whose articles have appeared in leading newspapers throughout the U.S. and Europe.

Together, they hashed out an agreement on what must be done to fight global warming.\u00a0\n\nClimate change activists are disappointed with the Paris agreement, however. In the words of Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders, it does not go \u201cfar enough.\u201d\n\nHigh on the list of climate change activists' policy goals is a tax on meat. Such a tax would be similar to the \"sin taxes\" levied on tobacco and alcohol, which are meant to help discourage the use of those products.\n\nThe theory is that meat, especially beef, is disproportionately responsible for greenhouse gas emissions. The activists claim that if we were able to change how people eat, primarily in wealthier countries like the United States, we could take a significant bite out of climate change.\n\nCase Against Meat A Stretch\n\nA blueprint to achieve the meat tax is laid out in a November report by Chatham House, a London-based think-tank. The group concedes that the issue is \u201ccomplex.\u201d\n\nYet it advises governments to push for the taxes through publicly funded public relations campaigns which make the matter appear clear-cut. The reason for this, it says, is that people \"respond best to simple messages.\u201d\n\nThis is an unusual recommendation for a group known for promoting open debate.\n\nIt is one thing to push vegetarian diets on the basis of health claims or animal rights. The environmental case against meat is a stretch, however. It requires fuzzy math and politicized science.\n\nThose backing the taxes point to the United Nations Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model, or GLEAM. In 2013 GLEAM concluded that livestock farming, including beef, poultry and milk production, accounted for 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHowever, the model was not developed as fodder for anti-meat campaigns. Rather, it was intended as a tool to guide the livestock industry toward more sustainable production.\n\nUsing GLEAM as scientific evidence to argue against meat consumption is as far-fetched as it would be to fight organic agriculture because it relies on manure, a source of methane and nitrous oxide, both greenhouse gases. No wonder advocates want to keep their messaging simple.\n\nChallenging A Simplistic Claim\n\nThe idea that reducing meat consumption would make both humans and the Earth healthier is challenged by considering the environmental impact of the alternatives.\n\nFor instance, almonds, a darling of health food advocates, are highly water-intensive. The U.N. has not yet calculated the water-footprint of your almond milk-based smoothie.\n\nSo what would be the environmental impact if we did reduce our caloric intake and shifted to the U.S. government\u2019s dietary guidelines?\n\nResearchers at Carnegie Mellon University evaluated just that. In a study published in Environment Systems and Decisions recently, they said such a change \u201cincreases energy use by 38 percent, blue water footprint by 10 percent, and GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions by 6 percent.\u201d\n\nOr, as the British newspaper The Independent reported it, \u201cLettuce is \u2018three times worse than bacon\u2019 for emissions and vegetarian diets could be bad for the environment.\u201d\n\nOf course, replacing meat with lettuce and comparing emissions on a calorie-for-calorie basis is absurd. However, it underscores a major point: meat is a highly efficient source of nourishment\u00a0\u2014 and tasty too.\n\nThe report explains that \u201cthese perhaps counterintuitive results are primarily due to USDA recommendations for greater caloric intake of fruits, vegetables, dairy and fish/seafood.\" Such foods \"have relatively high resource use and emissions per calorie.\u201d USDA is the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThis is not the first study to challenge the simplistic \u201cmeat is bad for the environment\u201d claim.\n\nAccording to a recent study from the University of Michigan\u2019s Center for Sustainable Systems, a shift from the \"current average U.S. diet to USDA dietary recommendations could result in a 12 percent increase in diet-related GHG emissions.\"\u00a0\n\nThe lesson: if you want to advocate for meat taxes, you will have to keep it simple. Otherwise, the science will get in the way of your agenda.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Jeff Stier is director of the risk analysis division of the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank.

Unless this rapid growth is reversed, grazing livestock will continue to release more and more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\u00a0\n\nCattle, sheep, pigs, chickens and other livestock release methane gas as a byproduct of food digestion.\u00a0Other greenhouse gases\u00a0are produced through the burning of fuels such as coal and oil.\n\nGreenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere and trap heat. Over time, they have caused a sharp rise in average global temperatures.\u00a0\n\nThis increase in temperature is known as global warming, or climate change. It has led to many serious environmental problems. For example, melting icecaps have caused sea levels to rise, threatening shorelines and island nations. Scientists say many other parts of the world may soon have too little water.\n\nAn Absurd Claim\n\nOne way Americans can help reduce the buildup of greenhouse gases is by changing their eating habits. The huge farms that produce most of our meat say that beef, lamb, chicken and pork\u00a0are healthy food choices.

It has stated that it accounts for one-third of all emissions created by U.S. agriculture.\n\nThe big livestock companies have made the problem worse by handling livestock manure carelessly. In order to save money, massive farms and ranches expose manure storage areas to oxygen and moisture. Such methods result in even higher methane levels in the atmosphere.\n\nNo one is calling for a ban on Big Macs or porterhouse steaks.

If we were able to change how people eat, tax supporters say, we could significantly slow climate change.\n\nArgument Uses Fuzzy Math\n\nA plan to achieve the meat tax is laid out in a report released by the group Chatham House.\u00a0\n\nThe group admits the issue is complicated.\u00a0Yet it advises governments to push for the taxes through public relations campaigns that make the matter appear clear-cut. The reason for this, it says, is that people \"respond best to simple messages.\u201d\n\nThis is an unusual suggestion for a group known for promoting open debate.\n\nIt is one thing to push vegetarian diets on the basis of health claims or animal rights. The environmental case against meat is a stretch, however. It requires fuzzy math and questionable science.\n\nThose backing the taxes point to the United Nations Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model, or GLEAM. The 2013 GLEAM claims livestock farming accounts for 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHowever, the model was not developed for use in anti-meat campaigns. Rather, it was intended to help the livestock industry become more environmentally responsible.\n\nUsing GLEAM as scientific evidence to argue against meat consumption is far-fetched. It is like fighting organic agriculture because it relies on manure. No wonder tax supporters want to keep their message simple.\n\nConsidering Environmental Effects\n\nThe idea that reducing meat consumption would make both humans and the Earth healthier is highly questionable. It is challenged by considering the environmental effects of switching to alternatives to meat.\n\nFor instance, growing almonds, a darling of health food fans, requires a huge amount of water. The U.N. has not yet calculated the water-footprint of your almond milk-based smoothie.\n\nFor years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has pushed Americans to eat less red meat, and more fruits, vegetables and grains.\u00a0Suppose Americans did follow these dietary guidelines. What effect would it have on the level of greenhouse gas emissions?\n\nResearchers at Carnegie Mellon University looked at just that question. They found that a shift toward eating more fruits and vegetables and less meat would increase\u00a0greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent. Energy use would go up 38 percent, and water use by 10 percent.\n\nThe British newspaper The Independent summarized the report this way: When it comes to greenhouse gas emissions, lettuce is \"three times worse than bacon.\" Vegetarian diets, the paper said, \"could be bad for the environment.\u201d\n\nOf course, replacing meat with lettuce and comparing relative emissions is absurd. However, it underscores a major point: meat is a highly efficient source of nourishment \u2014 and tasty too.\n\nMaking The Problem Worse\n\nThe\u00a0Carnegie Mellon\u00a0report explains that growing fruits and vegetables requires a great deal of energy. Much of the required energy use ends up producing new greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThis is not the first study to challenge the simplistic \u201cmeat is bad for the environment\u201d claim.\n\nAccording to a recent University of Michigan study, a shift to a USDA-recommended diet would have unintended effects. Switching to a diet heavier in fruit and vegetables could result in a 12 percent increase in greenhouse gas emissions.\u00a0\n\nThe truth is, science supports neither meat taxes, nor a move away from meat consumption. Neither step will help the environment. Indeed, both are likely to make the greenhouse gas problem even worse.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Jeff Stier is director of the risk analysis division of the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank.

Photo: AP/ Lee Jin-man\nPRO: Livestock produce a whopping 51 percent of all greenhouse gases\nUnless rapidly increasing meat consumption around the world is curtailed, grazing livestock will continue to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and further degrade the environment.\n\nAmericans can help in curtailing greenhouse gas emissions by changing their eating habits. Beef, lamb, chicken and pork, while described by Big Livestock as healthy food choices, are not.\n\nLivestock production currently accounts for significant greenhouse gas emissions worldwide and the situation is not getting any better.\n\nDeforestation to produce more grazing lands also contributes to a rapidly approaching global ecocide.\n\nThe folks behind Big Livestock, like their climate change-denying colleagues in the fossil fuel industry, have mounted an aggressively deceptive campaign against their critics.\n\nThey have even gone so far as to suggest, using junk science statistics prevalent among climate change deniers, that vegetarians contribute more to greenhouse gas emissions than meat eaters. Nothing could be more absurd.\n\nA groundbreaking 2006 report by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, titled \u201cLivestock\u2019s Long Shadow,\u201d concluded that 18 percent of annual global greenhouse gas emissions were caused by cattle, sheep, buffalo, pigs and poultry.\n\nMore recent scientific studies have raised to a whopping 51 percent the percentage of greenhouse gases being emitted by livestock. It is an amazing fact that livestock produce more greenhouse gases than all the cars, trucks, airplanes, trains and ships in the world combined.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has also sounded the alarm bell over the production of methane by livestock. The EPA has stated that methane emissions resulting from the digestive systems of livestock, a process known as enteric fermentation, represents a third of all emissions from the agriculture sector in the United States.\n\nAdding to the problem of methane emissions is improper manure handling procedures on the part of Big Livestock. In order to save money, massive industrial farms and ranches expose manure storage areas to oxygen and moisture, which contributes to methane levels in the atmosphere.\n\nNo one championing an environmentally sound livestock industry is calling for a ban on Big Macs or porterhouse steaks. However, there is a need for an overall reduction in the consumption of meat products by the United States and other economically advanced nations.\n\nNow that consumers in China and India are able to afford meat products, demand has skyrocketed but so have the adverse effects on the environment. Increased demand for feed grain has also contributed to global climate change.\n\nReducing meat consumption must be part of an overall strategy for \u201cclean\u201d farming. Improved and environmentally sustaining feeding practices, animal husbandry techniques, a livestock waste-to-clean energy system, and livestock health management must all be part of a livestock management infrastructure that can support a healthy environment.\n\nMedical experts agree that reducing meat consumption also benefits one\u2019s health.\n\nHowever, whether or not a person opts to be a vegetarian or a carnivore is a personal choice. Proposals by governments to impose meat and dairy taxes to offset environmental damage and public health problems take on the aura of \u201cnanny state\u201d interventionism.\n\nWhen it comes to the livestock industry and the environment it is a far better strategy to stick to the basic problem of greenhouse gas emissions and sound solutions to this particular problem rather than add medical concerns to the debate.\n\nAlthough Big Livestock scoffs at the notion of a link between their industry and climate change, consider the results of a study by the respected medical journal Lancet, which found that a reduction in meat consumption of just a half cup a day can significantly reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions.\n\nWe can all afford to make that easy sacrifice and our environment will be better off for it.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: The newly elected president of the Tampa Bay Press Club, Wayne Madsen is a progressive commentator whose articles have appeared in leading newspapers throughout the U.S. and Europe.

Bernie Sanders, it doesn\u2019t go \u201cfar enough.\u201d\n\nHigh on their list of policy goals is a tax on meat, akin to tobacco and alcohol \u201csin taxes.\u201d\n\nThe theory is that meat, especially beef, is disproportionately responsible for greenhouse gas emissions and if we were able to change how people eat, primarily in wealthier countries like the U.S., we could take a significant bite out of climate change.\n\nA blueprint to achieve the meat tax is laid out in a November report by Chatham House, a London-based think tank. The group concedes that the issue is \u201ccomplex.\u201d\n\nYet it advises governments to push for the taxes through publicly funded public relations campaigns which make the matter appear clear-cut, because \u201cpublics respond best to simple messages.\u201d\n\nThis is an unusual recommendation for a group known for promoting open debate.\n\nFor radical animal rights groups and puritanical health crusaders, promoting vegetarian diets is, well, a red-meat issue. But the environmental case against meat is a stretch, requiring fuzzy math and politicized science.\n\nThose backing the taxes cite the United Nation\u2019s Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model, or GLEAM, which concluded in 2013 that livestock, including beef, milk production, and poultry, accounts for 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHowever, the model was not developed as fodder for anti-meat campaigns, but rather as a tool to guide the livestock industry toward more sustainable production.\n\nUsing GLEAM as scientific evidence to argue against meat consumption is as far-fetched as it would be to fight organic agriculture because it relies on manure, a source of methane and nitrous oxide, both greenhouse gases. No wonder advocates want to keep their messaging simple.\n\nThe idea that reducing meat consumption would make both humans and the Earth healthier is challenged by consideration of the environmental impact of alternatives.\n\nFor instance, almonds, a darling of health food advocates, are highly water-intensive. The U.N. hasn\u2019t yet calculated the water-footprint of your almond milk-based smoothie.\n\nSo what would be the environmental impact if we did reduce our caloric intake and shifted to the U.S. government\u2019s dietary guidelines?\n\nResearchers at Carnegie Mellon University evaluated just that. In a study published in Environment Systems and Decisions last month, such a change \u201cincreases energy use by 38 percent, blue water footprint by 10 percent, and GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions by 6 percent.\u201d\n\nOr, as the British newspaper The Independent reported it, \u201cLettuce is \u2018three times worse than bacon\u2019 for emissions and vegetarian diets could be bad for environment.\u201d\n\nOf course, replacing lettuce for meat and comparing emissions on a calorie-for-calorie basis is absurd. But it underscores a relevant point: meat is actually nutrient dense \u2014 and tasty.\n\nThe report explains, \u201cthese perhaps counterintuitive results are primarily due to USDA recommendations for greater caloric intake of fruits, vegetables, dairy and fish/seafood, which have relatively high resource use and emissions per calorie.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first study to challenge the simplistic \u201cmeat is bad for the environment\u201d claim.\n\nAccording to a recent study from the University of Michigan\u2019s Center for Sustainable Systems, \u201cAn iso-caloric shift from the current average U.S. diet to USDA dietary recommendations could result in a 12 percent increase in diet-related GHG emissions, whereas a shift that includes a decrease in caloric intake, based on the needs of the population \u2014 assuming moderate activity, results in a small, 1 percent decrease in diet-related GHG emissions.\u201d\n\nThe lesson: if you want to advocate for meat taxes, follow the advice of the experts and keep it simple. Otherwise, the science will get in the way of your agenda.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Jeff Stier is director of the risk analysis division of the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank.

As a result, giant farms are raising more and more animals.\u00a0\n\nCattle, sheep, pigs, chickens and other livestock give off methane gas. The gas is released as their bodies break down the food they eat.\u00a0\n\nMethane gas is one of the greenhouse gases. Other greenhouse gases\u00a0are created when fuels such as coal and oil are burned.\n\nWhen greenhouse gases are released, they remain in the air. They build up in the atmosphere and trap heat. Over time, they have caused a steep rise in average global temperatures.\u00a0\n\nMelting Icecaps, Dry Riverbeds\n\nThe increase in temperature that greenhouse gases cause is known as global warming, or climate change. It has led to many serious problems.\u00a0\n\nFor example, rising temperatures have made giant icecaps melt. The water released by this melting ice is causing sea levels to rise. Coastal shorelines and island nations are being swallowed up by the rising waters.\u00a0\n\nIn other parts of the world, the problem is the opposite. Hot weather is drying up lakes and rivers. Scientists say many places may soon have too little water.\n\nOne way Americans can help is by changing their eating habits.\u00a0\n\nHuge farms produce most of our meat. These companies say beef, lamb, chicken and pork\u00a0are good food choices. They are not, because the way farm animals are raised is bad for the planet.\n\nLivestock produce a big part of the world's greenhouse gas. The situation is not getting any better. Indeed, it is quickly getting worse.\n\nThe big livestock companies are trying to convince us that eating meat is not part of the problem.\u00a0They have even suggested that vegetarians cause more greenhouse gas buildup than meat eaters. Nothing could be more ridiculous.\n\nWhat Some Studies Say\n\nNew studies show that half the world's greenhouse gas is created by livestock. Farm animals produce more greenhouse gas than all the cars, trucks, airplanes, trains and ships in the world put together.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is an agency of the U.S. government responsible for protecting the environment. The environment is the natural world we all live in.\n\nLike many scientists, the EPA believes methane gas released by livestock is a serious problem. It says such gas accounts for one-third of all greenhouse gas created by U.S. agriculture. Greenhouse gases are also produced when farmers burn fuels to power their tractors and other machines.\n\nNo one is saying we should never eat another hamburger or steak again. However, the United States and other rich countries do need to eat less meat.\n\nGetting people to eat less meat must be part of the push for cleaner farming. Farming has to change so it does less damage to the environment.\n\nEating less meat is not only good for the environment. Doctors say it is also good for your health.\n\nMaking A Small Sacrifice\n\nThe decision to be a vegetarian or a meat eater should be your own, though. Governments should not try to force people to eat one way or the other.\n\nWhen it comes to livestock and the environment, it is far better to stick to the methane gas problem. There is no need to throw in health concerns.\n\nAlso, government plans to tax meat go too far. The government should not punish people for eating meat.\n\nThe big livestock companies say there is no link between climate change and farm animals. Many scientists do not agree with them. One study found that eating just a half cup less of meat a day would greatly lower the amount of methane gas released.\n\nWe can all make that small sacrifice. It is easy to do and will help save our planet.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: The newly elected president of the Tampa Bay Press Club, Wayne Madsen is a progressive commentator whose articles have appeared in leading newspapers throughout the U.S. and Europe.

Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of Tribune or Newsela.\nCON: Eating less meat might actually hurt the environment\nRecently, many of the world's leaders met in Paris. Together, they reached an agreement on what must be done to fight global warming. Each country agreed it would work hard to lower the amount of greenhouse gas released every year.\n\nSome people are disappointed with the Paris agreement, however. They feel it does not go far enough.\u00a0\n\nOne of the big things such people want is a tax on meat. The added tax would make\u00a0meat more expensive. As a result, many people might decide to start eating less of it. The change would be good for the planet, they say.\u00a0\n\nSupporters of the tax say raising livestock produces too much greenhouse gas. They believe it is worse for the environment than raising other kinds of food.\u00a0\n\nThis Idea Won't Work\n\nTax supporters say we could greatly slow climate change if we can change how people eat. If fewer people ate meat, farms would raise fewer animals. Then, less methane gas would be released and global warming would slow.\n\nThe idea sounds reasonable. However, it would not actually work. People who say eating less meat is the answer are not thinking things through. They are not looking closely at what would happen if many people switched away from meat and began eating more of the other kinds of food.\n\nFor instance, many health food fans like to use almond milk in place of cow milk. However, growing almonds requires a great deal of water. Almonds can be bad for the planet, too. Growing them wastes a good deal of water at a time when much of the world's water supply is shrinking.\n\nFor years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has pushed Americans to eat less red meat, and more fruits, vegetables and grains. Doctors have long said eating that way is more healthy.\u00a0\n\nSuppose Americans did follow these suggestions. What effect would it have on the level of greenhouse gases?\n\nMore, Not Less, Greenhouse Gas\n\nScientists at Carnegie Mellon University looked at just that question. They found that a shift toward eating more fruits and vegetables would actually raise the amount of greenhouse gas released.\u00a0\n\nThe reason is that growing fruits and vegetables requires a lot of machinery. The machinery needs fuel to run. When that fuel is burned, greenhouse gases are released. In the end, more greenhouse gas would be produced than what farm animals cause.\n\nThe British newspaper The Independent put it simply. When it comes to greenhouse gases, lettuce is \"three times worse than bacon.\" Being a vegetarian \"could be bad for the environment,\u201d the paper said.\n\nGrowing fruits and vegetables also uses up a huge amount of water. Farmers would both use more water and burn more fuel if they switched to growing more fruits and vegetables.\u00a0\n\nIn the end, raising farm animals for meat is both less wasteful and less harmful for the environment. Of course, people still need their fruits and vegetables. However, it would not be healthier for the planet if we all began to eat less meat.\n\nThe\u00a0Carnegie Mellon\u00a0study is not the only one to challenge the idea that meat is bad for the environment.\u00a0A University of Michigan study also found that growing more fruits and vegetables would raise the level of greenhouse gasses.\u00a0\n\nThe truth is, science does not supports the idea of a meat tax.

Photo: Wikimedia Commons\nPRINCETON, N.J. \u2013 During my class last month, several students stood up and walked out. They joined a protest led by the Black Justice League (BJL). The BJL is a student group that protests the unfair police treatment of African-Americans.\u00a0There have been several police killings of African-Americans recently.\n\nAfter class, the BJL went to the office of the Princeton University president. They refused to leave until their demands were met. They demanded that all staff learn about different cultures. They insisted that all students take classes on the history of marginalized people and groups that have been treated unfairly. Another thing they want is for the school to build a space for the appreciation of African-American culture.\n\nOne demand received national attention. The BJL demanded that the school rename the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. They also want to remove a painting of Woodrow Wilson in the dining hall. The BJL said that Wilson was a racist, so honoring him is disrespectful to African-Americans.\n\nMany Of Wilson's Laws Helped Workers\n\nWoodrow Wilson was president of Princeton University and later became president of the United States. He created both forward-thinking and traditional rules.\n\nWilson was forward-thinking by passing laws that made things better for society. After he became president in 1913, he\u00a0passed laws\u00a0against\u00a0child labor. The new rules protected children from working too much. He also passed laws that gave more rights to workers.\n\nAt the end of World War I, Wilson helped to create a world peace treaty. The peace agreement called for the formation of \"a general association of nations.\" This became the League of Nations, which then became the larger United Nations.\n\nToday, the United Nations is an organization to which many countries belong. It allows the countries to work together and promote international cooperation.\n\nTurning Back The Segregation Clock\n\nHowever, Wilson's policies for African-Americans were traditional. In some ways, he made things worse for African-Americans. Before Wilson was president, many African Americans worked alongside whites in government jobs. Wilson decided to segregate workplaces and bathrooms by separating whites and blacks, even though this practice had ended after the Civil War.\n\nWilson gave African-Americans lower jobs than the one they previously had. When they protested, he told them that segregation was good.\n\nHistory is full of flawed people who did great things. The Founding Fathers and early presidents of the United States, like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, were slave owners. Some people say that at least they were no worse than the average people at their time. However, is that a good enough reason to continue honoring them?\n\nReaching Into Wilson's Full History\n\nIn New Orleans, a school board decided that schools should not be named after slave owners, even if they were presidents.\u00a0They renamed George Washington Elementary School after an African-American doctor who fought to end segregation in the way medicine was practiced.\n\nWilson\u2019s name was added to Princeton\u2019s School of Public and International Affairs in 1948. At that time, segregation in American was accepted. Today, segregation and slavery are unthinkable. We notice Wilson's racism in today's world more than we did in 1948.\n\nWilson\u2019s contributions to the university, the United States, and the world cannot and should not be erased. Instead, they should be recognized in a way that creates a conversation about how values have changed. Today's conversation should include both his positive achievements and his contributions to America\u2019s racist past.\n\nAt Princeton, this conversation could educate students and staff who do not know about the entire history of such an important figure.\u00a0Princeton can still honor and remember Wilson for the good that he did. The university should also remember that Wilson's racist views were wrong. This will present a fuller picture of Wilson's history.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "1220L": "Opinion: How far do we take demands to erase a part of history?\nBy Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n01.07.16\n\nWoodrow Wilson was the 28th president of the United States and the president of Princeton University.

The BJL is one of many student groups that have emerged across the United States since the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014, and other police killings of unarmed African-Americans.\n\nLater that day, members of the BJL occupied the office of Princeton University President Christopher Eisgruber, vowing not to leave until their demands were met. The first demand was to have \u201ccultural competency training\u201d for both academic and non-academic staff. A second was a requirement that students take classes on the history of marginalized people. Another demand was the provision of a space on campus dedicated specifically to African-American culture.\n\nThe demand that received national attention was for the university\u2019s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, and Wilson College, one of its residential colleges, to be renamed. The BJL wants to remove a large mural of Wilson, which hangs in the college dining hall. The League says that honoring Wilson is offensive to African-American students because Wilson was a racist.\n\nWilson Championed Reforms\n\nWilson was a progressive in domestic affairs and an idealist in foreign policy. His forward-thinking administration passed laws against child labor and granted new rights to workers. He also reformed banking laws and challenged monopolies. In the years after World War I, he insisted that foreign policy be guided by moral values, and advocated for democracy in Europe.\n\nHowever, his policies for African-Americans were reactionary and backward. In 1913, when he became U.S. president, he inherited a federal government that employed many African-Americans, some working alongside whites in mid-level management positions. Under his administration, racially segregated workplaces and washrooms, which had been abolished at the end of the Civil War, were re-introduced. African-American managers were demoted to lower positions. When a delegation of African-Americans protested, he told them that they should consider segregation a benefit.\n\nInternational Homage To His Achievements\n\nWilson\u2019s name features prominently at Princeton not only because he is one of the university\u2019s most famous graduates, and the only one to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. It is also because, before he was U.S. president, he was Princeton\u2019s president. In the words of Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former dean of the Woodrow Wilson School, he \u201cperhaps did more than anyone else to transform (Princeton) from a preppie gentlemen\u2019s preserve into a great research university.\u201d\n\nWilson is famous worldwide for the \u201cFourteen Points\u201d that he proposed as the basis of a peace treaty to end World War I. He called for autonomy for the peoples of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires, as well as an independent Polish state.\u00a0Today, there is a Wilson Square in Warsaw, Prague\u2019s main train station is named after him, and that there are Wilson streets in both Prague and Bratislava.\n\nAmong the other Fourteen Points is a call for open covenants, meaning no secret treaties plotting the post-war division of another country\u2019s territory. Another of the Points requested a reduction in trade barriers. Perhaps most important is the proposal for the formation of \u201ca general association of nations\" meant to \"guarantee political independence and territorial integrity\" among member countries.\n\nThat call led to the founding of the League of Nations, the predecessor of the United Nations. From 1920 until 1936, its headquarters was in the Palais Wilson, in Geneva. The building retains that name, and is today the headquarters of the U.N. Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nScrutinizing History\n\nHistory is full of deeply flawed people who did great things. In the United States, we have only to look at slave-owning Founding Fathers and early presidents like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. One might plead on their behalf that, in contrast to Wilson, they were at least no worse than the standards that prevailed in their time. But is that sufficient grounds to continue commemorating them?\n\nA New Orleans school board thought not. The school declared that no school should be named after a slaveholder and renamed George Washington Elementary School after an African-American surgeon who fought for desegregation of blood transfusions. Should the name of the nation\u2019s capital city be reconsidered, too?\n\nWhen Wilson\u2019s name was added to Princeton\u2019s School of Public and International Affairs in 1948, Rosa Parks\u2019 famous bus ride was still seven years away, and segregation in the American South was not under serious challenge. Now it is unthinkable. Wilson\u2019s racism therefore becomes more noticeable, and he ceases to embody the values that are important to Princeton University today.\n\nA 21st Century Conversation\n\nWilson\u2019s contributions to the university, the United States, and the world cannot and should not be erased from history. They should, instead, be recognized in a manner that creates a nuanced conversation about changing values. Today's conversation should include both his positive achievements and his contributions to America\u2019s once-racist policies and practices.\n\nAt Princeton, one outcome of that conversation should be the education of students and faculty who would otherwise be unaware of the complexity of an important figure in the university\u2019s history. The end result of the conversation we should be having may well be the recognition that to attach Wilson\u2019s name to a college or school sends a message that misrepresents the values that an institution stands for.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: Should we honor racists?\nBy Peter Singer, Project Syndicate\n01.07.16\n\nWoodrow Wilson was the 28th president of the United States and the president of Princeton University.

The same happens to great \u2013 or not-so-great \u2013 political leaders, who become symbolic vehicles for inculcating civic virtues.\n\nAs our moral standards shift, however, different characteristics of the historical person become more relevant, and the symbol can develop a different meaning. When Wilson\u2019s name was added to Princeton\u2019s School of Public and International Affairs in 1948, Rosa Parks\u2019 famous bus ride was still seven years away, and segregation in the American South was not under serious challenge.

Photo: Wikimedia Commons\nPRINCETON, N.J. \u2013 During my class last month, several students walked out. They went to a protest led by the Black Justice League (BJL). The BJL is a student group at Princeton University. The group has protested the unfair ways in which police treat African-Americans. There have been a number of violent events recently between police and African-Americans.\n\nThe BJL went to the office of the university's president. They said they would not leave until they got what they wanted. They demanded that the school teach students and teachers about African-American history.\n\nDemands For A New Name\n\nThere is a school at the university called the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. The BJL said that school should get a new name. The school teaches international studies. It is named after Woodrow Wilson. He was a president of the university. He also was president of the United States.\n\nThe BJL said Wilson was a racist. Naming a school after a racist is insulting to African-Americans, the group said.\u00a0The BJL also wants a painting of Wilson taken out of the dining hall.\u00a0\n\nI do not believe the request by the BJL is fair. Wilson did both good and bad things. We should remember both. If we change the name of the school, we will forget this history.\n\nSeparate Is Not Equal\n\nWilson did good things for the country and for the world.\u00a0After World War I, Wilson helped to write an agreement for world peace. The agreement happened in 1920 and included many countries. It later helped to make the United Nations. Today, the United Nations is a group that helps countries work together to avoid war.\u00a0\n\nThe BJL says Wilson also did some racist things. That is true. Wilson made old- fashioned laws for African-Americans. In 1913, when Wilson became president of the United States, whites and blacks were working together and had good jobs in the government.\u00a0\n\nWilson decided to separate whites and African-Americans. That is called segregation. He gave African-Americans lower jobs. He also said that African-Americans had to use different bathrooms than white people.\n\nYet Wilson was not much different from people throughout history.\n\nHow Should We Honor Them?\n\nMany people in history did good things and bad things. George Washington owned slaves. He was the first president of the United States. Many people had slaves in the 1700s. Thomas Jefferson did as well. Today, slavery is banned. The law does not allow for slavery anymore.\n\nIs it proper to honor George Washington today?\u00a0Some people\u00a0think it is OK to remember Washington because many people owned slaves back then. Washington did what was normal for the 1700s.\n\nIn Louisiana, one school decided it was not OK. They changed the name of George Washington Elementary School. They re-named it after an African-American doctor.\n\nLearning From The Good And Bad\n\nI think Princeton should not do the same thing as the school in Louisiana.\u00a0Wilson did good things for Princeton, the United States, and the world. It is also important to understand that some things he did were not good.\u00a0We know today that segregation and slavery are wrong.\n\nPrinceton can and will remember Wilson for the good that he accomplished. The university should not honor the racist things that Wilson did.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "1040L": "Opinion: Protests at Princeton over Woodrow Wilson's legacy\nBy Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n01.07.16\n\nWoodrow Wilson was the 28th president of the United States and the president of Princeton University.

There\u2019s plenty of space available.\n\nOn the surface, the phrase \u201creduce, reuse, recycle\u201d may seem like a sensible call to action. It makes particular sense to those who want to limit the amount of carbon dioxide we release into the air when we burn fossil fuels like gas and coal, and reduce the amount of waste left behind for future generations.\n\nThe reality, however, is that the cost of the recycling process almost always outweighs the benefits.\n\nGoing By The Numbers\n\nEven the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says it only makes sense economically and environmentally to recycle about 35 percent of our trash. Among those materials are paper and aluminum cans, according to the government department.\n\nRecycling 1 ton of paper or aluminum cans, the agency says, can save about 3 tons of carbon dioxide emissions over producing new materials. Carbon dioxide is produced during the recycling process and can lead to climate change. A ton equals 2,000 pounds.\n\nBut not so fast.\n\nPaper mills pay for the trees they process. If it was cost-effective to recycle scrap paper, paper companies would be beating down your door to buy it \u2014 but they aren\u2019t.\n\nThat means it\u2019s more expensive and takes more energy and water to recycle old paper than to cut down and process pine trees and then plant pine seedlings.\n\nPlastic provides another problem. Given the recent dramatic decline in oil prices, it is now cheaper to make a new plastic container than to recycle an old one.\n\nEven if that were not true, the EPA says that recycling a ton of plastic saves only about a ton of carbon dioxide. However, that estimate doesn\u2019t take into account the water most consumers use to rinse their plastic containers before they put them into a recycling bin.\n\nNew York Times science writer John Tierney recently wrote an article, citing the work of author Chris Goodall. He wrote, \u201cIf you wash plastic in water that was heated by coal-derived electricity, then the net effect of your recycling could be more carbon in the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nEmotion Over Reason\n\nGlass is an even worse recyclable. To reduce emissions by 1 ton you have to recycle 3 tons of glass. If you include the cost of collecting glass in small quantities from neighborhoods, and the pollution produced by the collection trucks and the recycling process itself, glass recycling creates more emissions. It is also more expensive than making new glass, which comes primarily from sand, an abundant raw material.\n\nNo wonder many municipalities across the country continue to pick up glass in recycling trucks only to dump it at the local landfill.\n\nWhy the charade? Because \u201creduce, reuse, recycle\u201d is an emotional slogan, not reasonable environmental policy. Years of brainwashing make most Americans blind to the actual evidence surrounding recycling programs.\n\nBy sending an extra fleet of trucks around town once a week, supporters of recycling actually are not protecting the environment.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the rise of the recycling movement has created a powerful group of people who pressure politicians to keep things the way they are.\n\nMore intelligent environmental policies would consider the costs and benefits of recycling programs. They should scrap those that are wasteful and harmful to the environment.\n\nIf recycling was truly cost-effective, companies would be lined up at your doorstep to buy your trash and make money from it. Don\u2019t look now, because they\u2019re not there.\n\nThe true recycling test is whether someone is willing to pay you to sort and save your trash. If they\u2019re not, what you\u2019ve been told about recycling in the past is probably just garbage.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER William F.

Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of Tribune or Newsela.\nCON: Recycling stops us from being so wasteful\nWe Americans consume a lot and waste a lot, which means we dump far more trash than is necessary into landfills. In fact, we produce twice as much waste per person as Western Europe.\n\nThe amount of municipal solid waste produced annually in the United States has tripled since 1960, and in 2013, it totaled 254 million tons. That\u2019s 4.4 pounds per person every day.\n\nWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress over the years in how we handle this waste. Recycling jumped dramatically nationwide after the mid-1980s. It leveled off around 2010, with the average American recycling or composting 34 percent of his waste.\n\nThe rate varies by the type of waste, and by state and city. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that we recycle 99 percent of lead acid batteries, 67 percent of paper, and 55 percent of aluminum cans. Yet, we recycle only 40 percent of electronics such as cellphones and computers, only 34 percent of glass containers and just 30 percent of plastic bottles and jars.\n\nCharging For Trash Encourages Recycling\n\nWe should be able to do much better than this. So why don\u2019t we? Individual habits are one explanation. Many people think recycling is not convenient, even in cities that send trucks house to house to collect recyclables. A number of states mandate recycling, but they don\u2019t enforce their laws, and in most cases they offer few incentives to recycle.\n\nSome states and cities do much better because they take recycling seriously. Cities such as Seattle, Washington, charge fees when people throw out garbage to encourage recycling. These fees are proportional to the amount of garbage put out for collection, a so-called pay-as-you-throw system. Even if the cost is small, it\u2019s an important incentive to encourage people to recycle, and they do.\n\nSeattle had a 50 percent recycling rate in 2014, and a 71 percent rate for single-family households, and the rate continues to improve. The city has set a goal of eliminating the \u201cmaximum possible amount of waste.\u201d Few other cities are so ambitious.\n\nSome critics see matters differently. They argue that recycling is too costly and ineffective to continue, and some states seem to agree with them. They have balked at paying part of the cost of municipal recycling, saying that cities should end their programs or pay for the cost themselves.\n\nAn Important Question\n\nIs this the right action to take, that we should recycle only if it generates enough benefits? Doing that would send exactly the wrong message as cities and businesses across the nation try to build a new commitment to the sustainable use of resources.\n\nSome experts believe that we should start by redesigning factories where possible to prevent or minimize waste in the first place. Then to the extent possible, we should reuse what is left over, and only then throw out anything that cannot be recycled.\n\nNo one argues that the cost of recycling is unimportant. But there are ways to deal with that cost rather than declare it over the top and abandon recycling programs. We could follow the lead of the most innovative cities by putting a price on trash. If people have to pay more, they will find ways to reduce the amount of trash they throw out, as will businesses, and the fees can cover the cost of recycling programs.\n\nThink about what else such fees might do to reduce extra packaging and wasted food. We toss out about 40 percent of the food we buy. This is one reason why several large cities, including San Francisco, California, and Seattle, now require household composting.\n\nWe are in the early stages of an important sustainability transition that will focus on efficiency throughout a product\u2019s life cycle, reducing the environmental impact, and rethinking business and household consumption. That\u2019s the way to go.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Michael Kraft is professor emeritus of political science and public and environmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.

If one includes the cost of collecting glass waste in small quantities from neighborhoods, and the pollution produced by the collection trucks and the recycling process itself, glass recycling creates more greenhouse gas emissions and is more expensive than making new glass, which comes primarily from sand, an abundant raw material.\n\nNo wonder many municipalities across the country continue to pick up glass in recycling trucks only to dump it at the local landfill.\n\nWhy the charade? Because \u201creduce, reuse, recycle\u201d is an emotional mantra, not reasonable environmental policy, and years of indoctrination has left most Americans blind to the actual evidence surrounding recycling programs.\n\nBy sending an extra fleet of trucks around town once a week, adherents of the recycling religion actually are undermining their stated goal of protecting the environment.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the rise of the recycling movement has created a powerful interest group of people who lobby politicians to keep things the way they are.\n\nMore rational environmental policies would consider the costs and benefits of recycling programs and scrap those that are wasteful and harmful to the environment.\n\nIf recycling were truly cost-effective, private companies would be lined up at your doorstep to buy your trash. Don\u2019t look now because they\u2019re not there.\n\nThe true recycling test is whether someone is willing to pay you to sort and save your trash. If they\u2019re not, what you\u2019ve been told about recycling in the past is probably just garbage.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER William F.

That means we dump far more trash than is necessary into landfills. In fact, we produce twice as much waste per capita as Western European nations.\n\nThe amount of municipal solid waste produced annually in the United States has tripled since 1960, and in 2013, it totaled 254 million tons. That\u2019s 4.4 pounds per person every day.\n\nWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress over the years in how we handle this waste. Recycling jumped dramatically nationwide after the mid-1980s, but it leveled off around 2010, with the average American recycling or composting 34 percent of his waste.\n\nThe rate varies by the type of waste, and by state and city. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that we recycle 99 percent of lead acid batteries, 67 percent of paper, and 55 percent of aluminum cans, but only 40 percent of the rapidly increasing quantity of consumer electronics such as cellphones and computers, only 34 percent of glass containers, and 30 percent of plastic bottles and jars.\n\nWe should be able to do much better than this. So why don\u2019t we? Individual habits are one explanation. Many people think recycling is inconvenient, even in cities that provide curbside, single-stream collection for recyclables. A number of states mandate recycling, but they don\u2019t enforce their laws, and in most cases they offer few incentives to recycle.\n\nSome states and cities do much better because they take recycling seriously as part of a broad commitment to sustainability. Cities such as Seattle impose fees that are proportional to the amount of waste put out for collection, a so-called pay-as-you-throw system. Even if the cost is small, it\u2019s an important incentive to encourage people to recycle, and they do.\n\nSeattle had a 50 percent recycling rate in 2014, and 71 percent for single family households, and the rate continues to improve. The city has set a goal of eliminating the \u201cmaximum possible amount of waste.\u201d Few other cities are so ambitious.\n\nSome critics see matters differently. They argue that recycling is too costly and ineffective to continue, and some states seem to agree with them. They have balked at continuing even a modest subsidy for municipal recycling, saying that cities should terminate their programs or pay for the cost themselves.\n\nIs this the right action to take? Recycle only if it generates enough benefits by some arbitrary metric? Doing that would send exactly the wrong message as cities and businesses across the nation try to build a new commitment to sustainable use of resources.\n\nExperts in sustainable management believe that we should start by redesigning production processes where possible to prevent or minimize waste in the first place. Then to the extent possible, we reuse what cannot be reduced, recycle what is left over, and only then dispose of what cannot be recycled.\n\nNo one argues that the cost of recycling is unimportant. But there are ways to deal with that cost rather than declare it excessive and abandon recycling programs. We could follow the lead of the most innovative cities by putting a price on trash. If people have to pay more, they will find ways to generate less waste, as will businesses, and the fees can cover the cost of recycling programs.\n\nThink about what else such fees might do to reduce excessive packaging and wasted food. We toss out about 40 percent of the food we buy. This is one reason why several large cities, including San Francisco and Seattle, now require household composting.\n\nThe EPA is trying to promote what it calls sustainable materials management as a long-term way to address all of these challenges.\n\nWe are in the early stages of an important sustainability transition that will put a premium on efficiency throughout a product\u2019s life cycle, reducing the environmental impact, and rethinking business and household consumption. That\u2019s the way to go!\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Michael Kraft is professor emeritus of political science and public and environmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.

There is plenty of room.\n\nPeople talk about \u201creduce, reuse, recycle.\u201d It may sound like a good idea to those who want to prevent climate change or keep garbage from piling up. Climate change is caused by burning fuels like oil or gas.\n\nThe truth, however, is that recycling has a cost. A big cost.\n\nIt's Cheaper To Make New Things\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is a government department in charge of the environment. The EPA says that it only makes sense to recycle about one-third of our trash because recycling more than that is too expensive.\n\nRecycling paper or aluminum does cause less pollution than making them from scratch.\n\nIt is not the whole story, though.\n\nPaper companies pay for the trees they use. If it was cheaper to recycle scrap paper, they would be beating down your door to buy it. They are not doing that, though.\n\nIt is more expensive to recycle old paper than to make new paper.\u00a0\n\nPlastic is another problem. It is made out of oil and recently the price of oil has gone way down. Now, new plastic containers are cheaper to make than recycling old ones.\n\nAlso, it wastes water. Many people rinse their plastic containers with water before they put them into a recycling bin. If they use hot water, gas or coal is burned to heat that water.\n\nRecycling Doesn't Really Save Money\n\nGlass is even worse. You have to recycle a lot of glass to reduce pollution by just a little. Yet, there is more. The glass has to be collected from neighborhoods. The trucks that collect the glass also cause pollution. Recycling glass is more expensive than making it from scratch. New glass is made mainly from sand, and there is plenty of that.\n\nMany cities pick up glass in recycling trucks. Then they just dump it at the local landfill.\n\nWhy are they pretending? Because people feel strongly about \u201creduce, reuse, recycle.\u201d They learn it in school and hear it all over the place. Most Americans do not know the evidence about recycling.\n\nCity and state officials should think about the costs and benefits of recycling programs. They should get rid of programs that waste money and hurt the environment.\n\nIf recycling saved money, companies would be lined up to buy your trash. Do not bother looking because they are not there.\n\nThere is a true recycling test. Is someone actually willing to pay you to sort and save your trash? If they are not, what you have been told about recycling in the past is probably just garbage.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER William F.

We dump far more trash than we need to into landfills. In fact, we make twice as much garbage per person as countries in Western Europe.\n\nSince 1960, the amount of trash thrown out each year has tripled. In 2013, it totaled 508 billion pounds. On average, each person threw out 4.4 pounds of garbage every day.\n\nWe have gotten a lot better at handling garbage. People began recycling much more after the mid-1980s. Now, on average, Americans recycle about one-third of their trash.\n\nLook At Seattle's Recycling Program\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is a government department. It reports that we recycle two-thirds of all paper and half of all cans. However, we recycle less than half of electronics, like cellphones and computers. We recycle only about a third of glass and plastic bottles and jars.\n\nWe should be able to do much better than this. So why are we not? Some people just do not want to do it. Many people do not think recycling is easy. A number of states say that people have to recycle, but they do not make people follow their laws. In most cases, they do not offer people much reason to recycle.\n\nSome states and cities do much better because they take recycling seriously. Cities such as Seattle, Washington, encourage recycling. They charge people money for throwing out garbage. The more garbage they throw out, the more they have to pay. It works.\n\nIn 2014, half the people in Seattle recycled their trash. The city is trying to get rid of the \u201cmaximum possible amount of waste.\u201d Few other cities have set such a high goal.\n\nHow To Throw Away Less Trash\n\nSome people see matters differently. They argue that recycling costs too much and is not effective. Some states seem to agree with them. They do not want to give money to help city recycling programs and say the cities should end their programs or pay for the cost themselves.\n\nIs this the right action to take? Recycle only if enough good things come from it? Doing that would send exactly the wrong message.\n\nSome experts believe that a good starting point is when a product is made. We should be careful to avoid waste. Then we should reuse and recycle what is left over. Only then should we throw out what cannot be recycled.\n\nNo one argues that the cost of recycling is not important. However, it is not a good enough reason to stop recycling.\n\nWe are in the early stages of an important change. It will cut down on garbage and pollution. It will also get people to change what they use and throw out. That is the way to go.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Michael Kraft is a retired political science and public and environmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.

Photo: AP/Mike Groll\nPRO: The costs of recycling outweigh the benefits\nIf you\u2019re worried about the planet, please make sure your garbage is buried in a landfill. There is plenty of space available.\n\nOn the surface, the phrase \u201creduce, reuse, recycle\u201d may seem like a realistic call to action. It makes particular sense to those who want to reduce the amount of oil and gas that are burned and halt climate change, and reduce the amount of garbage we will leave for future generations to deal with.\n\nThe truth, however, is that the cost of the recycling process almost always outweighs the benefits.\n\nEven the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says it only makes sense economically and environmentally to recycle about 35 percent of our trash. Among those materials are paper and aluminum cans, according to the government department.\n\nMore Expensive And More Electricity\n\nRecycling 1 ton of paper or aluminum cans, the agency says, can save about 3 tons of carbon dioxide emissions over producing new materials. Carbon dioxide, a gas, is produced during the recycling process and can lead to climate change. A ton equals 2,000 pounds.\n\nNot so fast.\n\nPaper mills pay for the trees they process. If it was cheap enough to recycle scrap paper, producers would be beating down your door to buy it. There is a good reason why they aren\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s more expensive and takes more electricity and water to recycle old paper than to cut down pine trees, turn them into paper, and then grow new trees.\u00a0\n\nPlastic, which is made from oil, is another problem. Recently the price of oil has gone way down. It has now become cheaper to make a new plastic container than to recycle an old one.\n\nAlso, the EPA says that recycling a ton of plastic saves only about a ton of carbon dioxide. However, that doesn\u2019t take into account the water to rinse their plastic containers before people put them into a recycling bin.\n\nJohn Tierney is a science writer for The New York Times newspaper. He pointed out that if people use hot water to wash plastic containers, they actually contribute to sending more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Coal or gas is burned to heat the water up in the first place.\n\nAre We Pretending About Recycling?\n\nGlass is even worse. To reduce emissions by 1 ton you have to recycle 3 tons of glass. Including the cost of collecting old glass from neighborhoods, and the pollution produced by the collection trucks and the recycling process itself, glass recycling creates more emissions. It is also more expensive than making glass from scratch. New glass is made mainly from sand, and we have plenty of cheap sand in the world.\n\nMany cities pick up glass in recycling trucks only to dump it at the local landfill.\n\nWhy are they pretending? Because people feel emotional about the motto \u201creduce, reuse, recycle.\u201d They learn it in school and hear it everywhere they go. Most Americans are blind to the evidence about recycling programs.\n\nMore environmentalists should consider the costs and benefits of recycling programs.

University of Texas. Photo: AP/Susan Walsh\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is once again considering the case Fisher v. University of Texas. It first sent the case back down to a lower court in 2013. Now the\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0has decided to take the\u00a0case back up, and will have to decide if colleges may consider race when choosing which students to admit.\u00a0\n\nThe case began when white student Abigail Fisher sued the University of Texas. Fisher claimed the university had denied her admission because of her race. She said she had been passed over in favor of a less qualified black student.\n\nIs The Mismatch Theory Right?\n\nFisher blamed so-called affirmative action policies for the fact that she was not admitted. Such policies require colleges to admit a certain percentage of nonwhite students. Fisher said affirmative action policies should be struck down as unconstitutional. She claimed they unfairly favor one group over another.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia so far seems to be siding with Fisher. He has also gone beyond her claim that affirmative action is unfair to whites. In his arguments Scalia has referred to the so-called mismatch theory.\u00a0\n\nThe mismatch theory holds that affirmative action places black students in schools that are \u201ctoo fast\u201d for them. The result is a mismatch between their true qualifications and the schools they attend. Many treat this theory as fact even though serious doubts have been raised about it.\n\nMinority Students And Stress\n\nCritics say affirmative-action policies give preference to students of color even when they are\u00a0less qualified. Students are defined as less qualified when they have\u00a0lower pre-college test scores and grades.\u00a0The fact that achievement gaps persist in college is often mentioned as proof that this idea is correct. In other words, if black students with lower SAT scores than their white peers also receive worse grades in college, then surely they were less college-ready to begin with.\u00a0\n\nHowever, the mismatch theory rests on an unproven assumption. It assumes that lower grades indicate lower ability. It ignores a large piece of the puzzle: many minority students face problems and pressures that white students do not. These can lead to mental attitudes that make performing well in school much more difficult.\n\nThreatened By Stereotypes\n\nWe and many others scientists have conducted experiments to try to determine how much of a role such attitudes play. We have been able to measure the effect certain kinds of pressures have on students\u2019 academic achievement. We have done so by observing what happens when those factors are removed. \u00a0\n\nOne psychological strain faced by students of color is stereotype threat. A stereotype is a widely held but false image of a particular group of people. Years of research have shown that widespread stereotypes of certain groups as less intelligent have a damaging effect. Students from these groups often worry they will be seen as less qualified. This threat makes them anxious. It can undermine their ability to learn and do well. It can make them more likely to avoid or switch out of difficult majors like math or science.\n\nWhen we give students exercises designed to reduce stereotype threat, we see strong results. The students soon earn better test scores and grades. Moreover, recent research of ours shows that students who have been given such exercises are also more likely to stick with difficult majors.\n\nBuild Trust, Raise Scores\n\nMany black and Latino students also face another problem: They expect to be treated differently than white students. This fear is not without cause, as racial bias still exists today in the education system. For example, black grade school students are more harshly punished and less kindly treated by teachers than their white peers. When students observe such differences, they may come to expect rejection from their professors. Such assumptions can undermine their trust, feelings of belonging, and motivation in school, and \u2014 in turn \u2014 their performance.\n\nTo combat these effects, we and other researchers have given black students exercises that promote trust in teachers. For example, students are taught that teachers criticize their work not because they think they are stupid, but because they want and expect them to do well. Such exercises reduce the difference in the scores of black and white students 40 to 50 percent. Moreover, the black students' scores continue to go up over time.\n\nIf these basic exercises have such a powerful effect, it cannot just be a lack of ability or preparation that is holding students of color back. Instead, it is likely that test scores and grades underestimate their ability. They may instead reflect the worries and fears such students have.\n\nAn Important First Step\n\nAffirmative action takes one very important step: It increases the chances that students of color will be accepted to schools that match their true ability level. Many such students are fully capable of doing high-level college work despite their lower high school test scores and grades.\u00a0\n\nHowever, this is only part of the solution. We also need to make sure that minority students can thrive once they are admitted to top colleges and universities.\u00a0\n\nAs an important first step, the Supreme Court must uphold affirmative action. Doing so will help ensure racial equality in education. Teachers and scientists must also continue to find ways to make colleges more supportive.

University of Texas at Austin has wound its way back to the Supreme Court, which will once again examine whether consideration of race in undergraduate admissions is constitutional. One striking development during the oral arguments on Dec. 9 was Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s invocation of the disputed mismatch hypothesis: that affirmative action hoists black students into schools that are \u201ctoo fast\u201d for them, leading to a mismatch between their true qualifications and the schools that they attend. Justice Scalia, along with the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation and others, continue to present this hypothesis as fact even though the primary evidence for this argument has been called into serious question by many scientists.\n\nAt the core of this argument is the idea that schools with race-conscious admissions policies give preference to students of color over white students even though they are objectively less qualified, as evidenced by lower average pre-college test scores and grades. That achievement gaps persist in college is often cited as proof that this idea is correct. In other words, if black students with lower SAT scores than their white peers also receive worse grades in college, or more often switch into \u201ceasier\u201d majors, then surely they were less college-ready to begin with. However, the underlying assumption that poorer academic outcomes indicate lower ability ignores a large piece of the puzzle: the taxing psychological environment faced by students of groups historically marginalized in academics.\n\nIn the abstract, it can be challenging to separate these two explanations\u2014psychological environment versus lower ability\u2014because they both result in the same outcomes: lower scores and greater attrition from challenging majors. However, social psychology offers a window into this otherwise black box through the use of experimental design. In the randomized controlled experiments that we (and many other social psychologists across the country) conduct in schools, we can directly measure the impact of the taxing psychological environment on students\u2019 academic achievement by observing what happens when we remove psychological strain as a factor. \u00a0\n\nOne psychological strain faced by students of color that we study in our experiments is stereotype threat. Decades of science has shown that pervasive stereotypes of certain identity groups as less intelligent or less capable in academics often lead students of these groups to worry that they could be judged through the lens of these negative stereotypes. This threat is stressful and can undermine these students\u2019 learning, performance, and engagement. Few of us can perform at our best in an environment we perceive as judgmental or skeptical\u2014this is no different, except that the judgmental environment is chronic.\n\nWhen we give students exercises designed to reduce stereotype threat, we see their school performance and engagement increase, and the racial achievement gap shrinks. They earn better test scores and grades. Meta-analyses comparing the performance of the thousands of students who have received these relatively simple threat-reducing exercises over the past 10 years to that of their peers in control groups estimate that reducing stereotype threat alone accounts for the equivalent of about a 62 point increase on the SAT\u2014and this is almost certainly a conservative estimate, because no one experimental exercise can remove stereotype threat or its effects entirely. Moreover, recent research in our laboratory shows that college students who participate in these exercises are also more likely to continue taking classes in \u201chard\u201d STEM majors. These results suggest that students\u2019 psychological environment plays a large role in both their grades and major selections.\n\nAnother aspect of the psychological environment we target with experimental exercises is the expectation of many black and Latino students that they will be treated differently in academic environments than white students. This expectation is not unfounded; research consistently shows that bias still exists today in the education system. For example: professors are less likely to respond to emails from students of color requesting research opportunities or mentorship than emails from white students; readers told that an essay writer is black evaluate that essay as poorer quality than when they are told the writer is white; and black grade school students face harsher disciplinary action and less warmth from teachers and administrators than their white peers. When students observe differences such as these, they may, understandably, come to expect rejection both from their professors and peers, which can undermine their trust, feelings of belonging, and motivation in school, and\u2014in turn\u2014their performance.\n\nTo combat these effects, we and other researchers have given black students exercises that promote trust in educators or foster feelings of belonging at school. In these exercises, participants read brief testimonies ostensibly written by older students that normalize adversity and reduce the expectation of race-based rejection. For example, students may read testimonies explaining that instructors' critical feedback is motivated by high expectations or that social adversity in college is common and transient, instead of stemming from racial bias. We find that these exercises reduce the academic achievement gap between treated black students and their white peers 40 to 50 percent. Moreover, these effects tend to strengthen over time; three years after the belonging exercise, the grade gap between treated black and white students had closed by 79 percent.\n\nIf these modest exercises to reduce psychological strain in the academic environment can have such a powerful effect on the performance and engagement of students of color, without changing anything about their knowledge or credentials, it cannot be simply a lack of ability or preparation holding back these students\u2019 achievement. Instead, this extensive body of research suggests that academic outcome measures such as test scores and grades habitually underestimate the ability of students of color, and instead often reflect the presence of threat in their environment\u2014both before and during college.\n\nTo put it another way: Let\u2019s imagine that we strap a 15-pound weight to a runner\u2019s back during her qualifying race. She will run slower than she otherwise would have. The lazy solution\u2014the \u201cmismatch\u201d solution\u2014would be to keep the weight on her back and assign the runner to a slower heat where she might be able to win, despite the extra weight. Most would probably agree, however, that the real solution is to remove the weight and assign the runner to the faster heat that matches her true ability level.\n\nAffirmative action takes one very important step: It increases the chances that students of color will be accepted to the schools that match their true ability level, despite test scores that are often depressed by taxing psychological environments. But this is only part of the solution. We also need to remove the weight, so that racial academic achievement gaps don\u2019t persist even after highly qualified minority students are admitted to top colleges and universities. To make progress in racial equality in higher education, the Supreme Court must uphold affirmative action; we as scientists and educators must continue to find ways to build inclusive psychological environments in academia, so that students of color can reach their full potential.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "700L": "Opinion: Minority students face problems that can hurt grades\nBy Scientific American, adapted by Newsela staff\n12.22.15\n\nJheanelle Wilkins, of New Castle, Delaware, (right) and Neo Moneri, of Beltsville, Maryland, participate in a rally outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., Oct. 10, 2012, supporting the University of Texas while the highest court in the land heard arguments in Fisher v. University of Texas. Photo: AP/Susan Walsh\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is our country's highest court. Right now it is studying the case Fisher v. University of Texas.\u00a0\n\nFisher v. University of Texas is a very important case.\u00a0It has to do with the way schools decide who to admit.\u00a0\n\nAfter high school many students go on to college or university. Colleges and universities can only take some of the students who want to get in. There is simply not enough room for everyone.\n\nWho Gets Into College?\n\nFisher v. University of Texas has been going on for awhile. It\u00a0began when white student Abigail Fisher sued the University of Texas. Fisher said the school decided not to admit her because of her race. She said a black student with worse grades got in instead of her.\n\nFisher says she was not admitted because of affirmative action.\u00a0\n\nSchools that believe in affirmative action look at the race of students when deciding who to accept. They want to accept students from groups that were treated unfairly in the past. Both blacks and Latinos are among such groups.\u00a0\n\nUnfair To White Students?\n\nFisher says affirmative action should be against the law. She claims it is unfair to whites.\n\nThe Supreme Court Justices will decide if affirmative action should still be allowed. There are nine judges on the Supreme Court. Right now, some are for it and some are against it.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia is against affirmative action. He says it\u00a0puts black students in schools that are \u201ctoo fast\u201d for them. His idea is known as the mismatch theory.\n\nIs The Mismatch Theory True?\n\nMany treat this idea as fact. However, many scientists say it may not be true.\n\nPeople who support the theory say affirmative action is bad for nonwhite students. They say some students of color are admitted to good colleges even though they have low grades. Such students are not ready for college, they say. They just end up doing badly.\n\nHowever, students can have low grades and still be smart. Some students just need a bit of help to do better.\n\nMany nonwhite students face problems that white students do not. These can make schoolwork much more difficult.\n\nStruggles With Stereotypes\n\nStereotypes are one problem students of color face. A stereotype is a common but wrong idea about a particular group of people. For example, many people believe certain groups are not as smart as others.\u00a0\n\nStudents from these groups often worry people will think they are unintelligent. Their fear can make it harder for them to learn and do well.\n\nWe have given students exercises that lower their fear of being seen as unintelligent. The results are striking. Such students soon start getting better grades.\u00a0\n\nUnfair Treatment For Black Students?\n\nMany black and Latino students also face another problem. They expect to be treated differently than white students. In fact, before college they often are. For example, in some schools black students are punished more harshly than white students.\u00a0\n\nStudents who notice such differences may expect college teachers to be unfair to them. Such thoughts can make them feel they do not belong in college. In turn, that can make them do less well.\n\nMore Trust Means Better Grades\n\nThere are ways to help. We have given black students exercises that build trust in teachers. Students learn that teachers want them to do well. Such exercises have made black students' grades go up quite a bit.\n\nThe Supreme Court should uphold affirmative action. It makes colleges fairer. It raises the chances that students of color will get into schools that match their true skills.\u00a0\n\nColleges must also work harder. They must make students of color feel they belong. Only then will such students be able to do their best.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "1230L": "Opinion: Affirmative action students can thrive in top schools\nBy Scientific American, adapted by Newsela staff\n12.22.15\n\nJheanelle Wilkins, of New Castle, Delaware, (right) and Neo Moneri, of Beltsville, Maryland, participate in a rally outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., Oct. 10, 2012, supporting the University of Texas while the highest court in the land heard arguments in Fisher v. University of Texas. Photo: AP/Susan Walsh\nThe legal case Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin has made its way back to the Supreme Court. The court sent it back down to a lower court in 2013. Now the Supreme Court has chosen to hear the case once again, and will try to decide if it is constitutional for colleges to consider race when selecting students to admit.\n\nThe case began when white student Abigail Fisher sued the University of Texas, saying it had denied her admission because of her race. Fisher claimed she had been passed over in favor of a less qualified black student. She blamed affirmative action policies that require the admission of a certain percent of nonwhite students, and said such policies should be struck down.\n\nQuestioning The Mismatch Theory\n\nOne striking development as the court began considering the case was Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s reference to the mismatch theory: that affirmative action places black students in schools that are \u201ctoo fast\u201d for them, leading to a mismatch between their true qualifications and the schools they attend.

However, the assumption that lower grades indicate lower ability ignores a large piece of the puzzle: the psychological stress faced by many minority students.\n\nStress And Stereotypes\n\nIt can be challenging to separate these two explanations \u2014 psychological environment versus lower ability \u2014 because they both can be linked to the same results: lower scores and a greater tendency to switch out of \"harder\" majors. However, science may provide an answer. In the experiments that we (and many others) conduct, we can measure the impact certain kinds of stress have on students\u2019 academic achievement by observing what happens when those factors are removed. \u00a0\n\nOne psychological strain faced by students of color is stereotype threat. A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified or false image of a particular group of people. Decades of research have shown that widespread stereotypes of certain groups as less intelligent often lead students from these groups to worry that they will be seen as less qualified. This threat is stressful. It can undermine these students\u2019 learning, performance, and engagement.\n\nReducing Bias\n\nWhen we give students exercises designed to reduce stereotype threat, we see their school performance and engagement increase. They earn better test scores and grades. Some large-scale studies indicate that reducing stereotype threat can lead to the equivalent of about a 62 point increase on the SAT. Moreover, recent research of ours shows that students who have been given such exercises are also more likely to continue taking classes in difficult majors.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the expectation of many black and Latino students that they will be treated differently than white students. This expectation is not without cause: bias still exists today in the education system. For example, black grade school students face harsher disciplinary action and receive less warmth from teachers than their white peers. When students observe such differences, they may come to expect rejection from their professors. Such expectations can undermine their trust, feelings of belonging, and motivation in school, and \u2014 in turn \u2014 their performance.\n\nPromoting Trust\n\nTo combat these effects, we and other researchers have given black students exercises that promote trust in educators or foster feelings of belonging at school. For example, students may read testimonies from older students explaining that instructors' critical feedback is\u00a0not of of racial bias, but is\u00a0intended to help them meet high expectations. Such exercises reduce the academic achievement gap between these black students and their white peers 40 to 50 percent. Moreover, these effects tend to strengthen over time: Three years after the belonging exercise, the grade gap between treated black and white students had closed by 79 percent.\n\nIf these modest exercises can have such a powerful effect on the performance of students of color, it cannot be simply a lack of ability or preparation holding such students back. Instead, it is likely that test scores and grades underestimate the ability of students of color. They may instead reflect the psychological stress such students experience.\n\nEasing The Load\n\nTo put it another way: Let\u2019s imagine that we strap a 15-pound weight to a runner\u2019s back during her qualifying race. She will run slower than she otherwise would have. The lazy solution \u2014 the \u201cmismatch\u201d solution \u2014 would be to keep the weight on her back and assign the runner to a slower heat where she might be able to win, despite the extra weight.

The governors are the top leaders of the states.\n\nThe Syrians the governors want to keep out are refugees. They escaped Syria's bloody war. Now they are looking for a new home.\n\nThe governors are making a big mistake. They are wrong not just because they should help people in need. What they are doing is helping the Islamic State group.\u00a0\n\nIslamic State, also called ISIS, has conquered parts of Syria and Iraq. The group's fighters are trying to spread their own kind of Islam.\u00a0\n\nWhat Islamic State Wants\n\nIslam is one of the world's main religions. There are many kinds of Islam, just like there are many kinds of Christianity. Believers in Islam are known as Muslims.\u00a0\n\nMany of the Syrian refugees are Muslims.\u00a0Most Muslims have nothing to do with groups like ISIS. They want nothing more than to live in peace like anyone else.\n\nIslamic State fighters say they are at war with the West. They say they will strike at Westerners in the United States and Europe.\n\nThe first thing we need to understand is that Islamic State is weak. Most Muslims do not like the group at all.\u00a0\n\nIslamic State does not want us to know that. The group wants us to believe their fighters are everywhere. They want us to be afraid.\u00a0\n\nThe group also\u00a0wants us to turn against Muslims everywhere. They\u00a0want us to hate all Muslims. They believe if that happens millions of peaceful Muslims will join them.\n\nIslamic State also wants us to turn away Syrian refugees. Doing that would make it look like we are against all Muslims.\n\nU.S. Should Not Be Afraid\n\nThe war in Syria began in 2011. Since then, 11 million Syrians have been forced to leave their homes. More than 250,000 people have died in that war.\n\nMany Syrians left the parts of Syria that Islamic State took over. They were afraid for their lives.\n\nThe U.S. government promised to take in 10,000 new Syrian refugees. They are supposed to be spread out among the states.\n\nMany state governors are trying to block those plans.\u00a0\n\nThe governors say Islamic State fighters may sneak in among the refugees. They should not be worried. The U.S. government screens refugees very carefully.\u00a0\n\nAbout half of these refugees are children. Another quarter of the refugees are elderly.\u00a0\n\nWe should not be afraid of them.

Photo: AP/Raad Adayleh\nPRO: Militants may sneak in with the refugees\nPresident Barack Obama is once again faced with a problem of his own making. He has no one to blame but himself if\u00a0some people no longer trust his assurances.\n\nFor seven years, the president has dismissed, demeaned and denounced those who have raised reasonable concerns about his policies.\n\nWhen those concerns have turned out to be correct, as they often have, he ignores the evidence, insults his critics and asserts that everything is going well. Remember, for example, his assertion that Islamic State was being \u201ccontained.\" The attacks that followed that claim certainly proved that those who questioned him were right to be worried. Recall his promise of a post-partisan America in which Democrats and Republicans would be able to work together. Today, the country remains as divided as ever.\n\nSo when 31 governors turned their thumbs down on Obama\u2019s decision to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees and distribute them among the states, they were sending a message: \u201cWe do not trust you and your administration to tell the truth or do the due diligence necessary to vet refugees.\u201d\n\nBenefit Of The Doubt? No!\n\nLet us be clear: Every governor knows this is a country of immigrants with a long and cherished tradition of helping refugees.\u00a0\n\nThey also know that the vast majority of the Syrian refugees would be honest and law-abiding. Most are simply fleeing a violent civil war they had nothing to do with starting. Many are fleeing the Islamic State, which had taken over parts of their war-torn country. They would be thrilled to get a chance at a new start in America.\u00a0\n\nEven a vast majority is not 100 percent, however, and that presents a safety concern which is worth taking seriously. If even a few Islamic State fighters slipped in with the refugees, that could be a huge problem.\u00a0\n\nHowever, Obama, true to form, dismissed the concerns and ridiculed the critics. \u201cApparently they (the Republicans) are scared of widows and orphans coming into the United States of America,\u201d the president said. He then claimed that the screening process would be the most careful and thorough process \"conceivable.\u201d\n\nIs that so? Remember when Obama administration officials boasted about how well the HealthCare.gov website would work right before its problem-plagued rollout? So what about refugee screening technology? Why should we assume that would work any better?\n\nUnder normal conditions, elected officials and most of the public would take the president\u2019s word. However, this president has misled the public so often that he has not earned the benefit of the doubt \u2014 and he is not getting it.\n\nRefugees Won't Be Properly Screened\n\nThe governors resisting the refugee resettlement simply do not trust Obama\u2019s claim that all of the refugees will be checked out extremely carefully. Neither does the public. A Rasmussen poll showed some 60 percent of likely voters \u201coppose the settling of Syrian refugees in the state where they live.\u201d Even many elected Democrats have their doubts.\n\nThis same president keeps trying to move prisoners from Guantanamo in Cuba to the United States. He has repeatedly assured governors that the prisoners, who are all suspected militants, are not a threat. The president continues to make that claim even though more than 100 of those who have been released have rejoined militant groups.\n\nTo make matters worse, the administration has resorted to making ridiculous statements about the Syrian refugees.\n\nFor example, the State Department says that only 2 percent of Syrian refugees admitted to this country since 2011 are \u201cmilitary-age males.\u201d So what?

They are also helping Islamic State.\u00a0\n\nIslamic State,\u00a0also known as ISIS,\u00a0is a militant group. Its members are trying to spread their own brand of Islam throughout the Middle East. They have conquered territory in Syria and Iraq, where they are now battling both Western and Arab forces.\u00a0\n\nThe group's dream is to establish an Islamic state shaped after their own beliefs. They are using violence and fear to advance those ends. They see themselves as being at war not only with Arab governments, but with the West.\n\nThe first thing we need to understand is that Islamic State is actually weak. It claims responsibility for any act of violence carried out by Muslims on Western soil so that it can appear stronger than it actually is.\n\nMost attacks have actually been the acts of do-it-yourself militants unconnected to any group. But Islamic State does not want us to know that. The group's fighters want us to believe they are everywhere. They want us to be afraid.\u00a0\n\nSetting Muslims Against The West\n\nIslamic State fighters also\u00a0want us to get angry and condemn Muslims everywhere. They\u00a0want to make Muslims the enemy of the West. They believe if that happens, millions of peaceful Muslims living around the world will join them.\n\nTheir goal is quite simple. They aim to divide us. They would like nothing more than to have the Western world accept Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s idea for a Muslim database or ID patch. They want us to see the world in terms of us against them.\n\nIslamic State also wants us to turn away Syrian and other Muslim refugees.\n\nSince 2011 when civil war broke out in Syria, 11 million Syrians have fled their homes for safety. Many\u00a0are fleeing Islamic State's reign of terror. More than 250,000 people have died in that war.\u00a0\n\nThe fighting in Syria began as an attempt to remove Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, who many see as undemocratic and oppressive. Over time, Islamic State fighters have become increasingly involved in the war.\u00a0\n\nWhile Islamic State also would like to see Assad gone, its goal is not greater democracy. Instead, its fighters hope to seize power themselves, in order to impose their own brand of Islam. Many Syrians have fled territories now controlled by the group's fighters, who have introduced extremely harsh laws.\n\nThe current refugee crisis is the biggest since World War II, with Syrians now making up the world\u2019s largest refugee population. Most are struggling to find new homes in Europe, and the United States needs to help.\u00a0\n\nDon't Make It \"Us Against Them\"\n\nThe Obama administration has pledged to take in 10,000 new Syrian refugees. They are supposed to be distributed among the states.\n\nThe government's plan has met with resistance, however. So far, 31 governors have protested the admission of Syrian refugees. They have gone as far as to say that their states will refuse to take them in.\n\nTheir fear, that Islamic State fighters will sneak in among the refugees, is not justified. The U.S. refugee-screening process is extremely difficult to get through. Most refugees stay in camps for months to years while their personal stories are evaluated and checked.\n\nAbout half of these refugees are children, while another quarter are elderly. Almost all of the adults are either mothers or couples coming with children.\n\nBy refusing to take in these war-torn refugees, these U.S. governors are not only going against our ideals as a nation. They are also helping Islamic State by dividing us even further. They are helping Islamic State by showing that our leaders want to turn away these desperate families, because it is \"us against them.\"\n\nThe 31 irresponsible governors are also sending a message to the U.S. public that fear, prejudice and even outright hate are acceptable. This ill-informed policy is not reflective of what is at the core of our national history. Every time U.S. leaders have followed similar paths in the past, their fears have been proven to be irrational. Every time similar things have happened, we as a nation have had to correct course.\n\nLet us not forget what is inscribed on the Statue of Liberty, quite possibly America\u2019s most widely recognized symbol:\n\n\u201cGive me your tired, your poor,\n\nYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\n\nThe wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\n\nSend these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,\n\nI lift my lamp beside the golden door!\u201d\n\nCan you honestly read that and feel we should reject these victims of Islamic State?\n\nLet us not accept this fear only to be proven wrong by history yet again. Instead, let us reject leaders, whether governors or members of Congress, who want to fan baseless fear. Let us educate ourselves about the horrors these refugees are fleeing, and the significant hurdles they must clear to be admitted. More than anything, let us light the way for a safer world by leading with an example of humanity.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Don Kusler is the executive director of Americans for Democratic Action, a national liberal advocacy organization (www.adaction.org).\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers.

After all, when you sow disgust you reap mistrust.\n\nFor seven years the president has dismissed, demeaned and denounced those who have raised legitimate concerns about his policies.\n\nAnd when those concerns have turned out to be correct, as they often have \u2014 think \u201cif you like your health care plan, you can keep it,\u201d Islamic State being \u201ccontained,\u201d the promise of a post-partisan America, and so on \u2014 he ignores the evidence, berates his critics, and asserts that everything is going well.\n\nSo when 31 governors turned their thumbs down on Obama\u2019s decision to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees and distribute them among the states, the governors were sending a message that said, \u201cWe do not trust you and your administration to tell the truth or do the due diligence necessary to vet refugees.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Every governor knows this is a country of immigrants with a long and cherished tradition of helping refugees.\n\nAnd they know that the vast majority of the refugees would be honest and law-abiding, thrilled to get a chance at a new start in America. But even a vast majority isn\u2019t 100 percent, and that presents a legitimate safety concern.\n\nBut Obama, true to form, dismissed the concerns and ridiculed the critics. \u201cApparently they (the Republicans) are scared of widows and orphans coming into the United States of America,\u201d the president sneered. He then claimed that the screening process would be the \u201cmost rigorous process conceivable.\u201d\n\nIs that so? Remember Obama administration officials boasting how well the HealthCare.gov website would work right before its disastrous rollout? So what about refugee screening technology?\n\nUnder normal circumstances, elected officials and most of the public would take the president\u2019s word. But this president has misled the public so often that he hasn\u2019t earned the benefit of the doubt \u2014 and he isn\u2019t getting it.\n\nThe governors resisting the refugee resettlement simply don\u2019t trust Obama\u2019s claims of stringent security checks. And neither does the public. A Rasmussen poll showed some 60 percent of likely voters \u201coppose the settling of Syrian refugees in the state where they live.\u201d Even many elected Democrats are skeptical.\n\nThis same president keeps trying to relocate Guantanamo detainees stateside, assuring governors the prisoners are not a threat \u2014 even though more than 100 of them who have been released have rejoined jihadist groups.\n\nExacerbating the mistrust, the administration has resorted to making ludicrous statements.\n\nFor example, the State Department says that only 2 percent of Syrian refugees admitted to this country since 2011 are \u201cmilitary-age males.\u201d So what? Anyone watching the news can see that young and middle-age adult males make up a good portion of those currently fleeing Syria.\n\nEven if the State Department restricted the 10,000 refugees to \u201cwidows and orphans,\u201d widows have brothers and orphans have uncles. Wouldn\u2019t there be a need to let other family members in, if not now, then soon, in order to help provide for the resettled women and children? And, of course, some women have been suicide bombers.\n\nHere\u2019s the point: Those who are frustrated with the refugee stalemate need to focus their ire on the president, not the governors. Obama entered the White House determined to prove that big government can do big things well. Instead, he has increased Americans\u2019 long-held skepticism of big government.\n\nRemember the IRS scandal? The Environmental Protection Agency polluting a Colorado river? The Veterans Affairs\u2019 health care scandal? And that \u201cred line\u201d in Syria?\n\nI, for one, hope the administration, Congress and governors can find a solution that upholds the country\u2019s long tradition as a haven for refugees. The mistrust in this case isn\u2019t targeted so much at the Syrian refugees, but at the White House.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Merrill Matthews is a resident scholar with the Institute for Policy Innovation in metropolitan Dallas.

Many of these refugees are still hoping to find a new home.\n\nDifferent groups are fighting in Syria. One is known as Islamic State, or ISIS. Islamic State has taken over parts of Syria. It wants to push its type of Islam on the country.\u00a0\n\nIslam is a religion, just like Christianity or Judaism. Its followers are known as Muslims. Most Muslims do not support Islamic State. In fact, many of the Syrian refugees left their country to get away from the extremist group.\n\nU.S. forces are now\u00a0fighting Islamic State.\u00a0Many worry that Islamic State fighters could attack here in this country.\n\nIslamic State Fighters Could Sneak In\n\nThe U.S. government wants to help the Syrian refugees. President Barack Obama announced that the U.S. will take in 10,000 of them. They are supposed to go to many different states.\n\nThe president's plan has run into a problem, however. The governors of 31 states are not going along. They say they do not want Syrian refugees in the states they lead. They worry that Islamic State fighters could sneak in with the real refugees.\n\nPresident Obama says there is no reason to worry. All the refugees will be checked very carefully, he says. They will not be allowed to live here until the government knows for sure they are not secret fighters.\n\nThe 31 governors and many other Americans do not believe Obama. They do not think the screening will be as careful as the president says.\u00a0\n\nObama brought this problem on himself. People no longer trust what he says. He has said too many things that turned out not to be true. For example, he said Islamic State was being \u201ccontained.\" He told people the group was almost beaten. Then, they attacked again.\u00a0\n\nWhat if there are also problems with the refugee checking? What if the screening does not work as well as the president says it will?\n\nMany people no longer believe Obama. They think the screening will not be that careful. They worry enemy fighters will slip in unnoticed.\n\nThere Is A Danger\n\nThe governors know that almost all the Syrian refugees are honest and peaceful.\u00a0Almost all is not everyone, though. It would be a huge problem if even a few Islamic State fighters slipped in. The danger is worth taking seriously.\n\nThe president and the government have been making silly statements about the Syrian refugees. Such statements only make people trust the government less.\n\nFor example, the government says the refugees are mostly women and children. It says very few of the Syrian refugees already in this country are men of fighting age. So what? What matters is who wants to come now. Many who just left Syria are young or fairly young men.\n\nThere would still be a problem even if the government only let in women and children. The women and children would have brothers, fathers and uncles. Sooner or later the men would try to come here, too. They would want to help take care of the women and children.\u00a0\n\nIn any case, some Islamic State fighters are women.\n\nMany people are unhappy that the refugees are not being let in. They should not be angry at the governors. They should be angry at the president instead.\u00a0People just do not believe Obama when he says there is no reason to worry. It is his fault they do not believe him.\n\nI hope the president and the governors can find an answer that will allow us to take the refugees. It is not that people do not trust the refugees themselves. The problem is that many people no longer trust the president.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Merrill Matthews is a resident scholar with the Institute for Policy Innovation in metropolitan Dallas.

He has no one to blame but himself if\u00a0some people no longer trust what he says.\n\nFor seven years, the president has dismissed and insulted those who raise reasonable concerns about his plans and decisions.\n\nWhen those concerns have turned out to be correct, as they often have, he ignores the evidence. Instead, he insults those who do not agree with him and claims that everything is going well.\u00a0Remember, for example, his assertion that the Islamic State group was being \u201ccontained.\" The attacks that followed that claim certainly proved those who questioned him were right to be worried.\n\nSo when 31 governors turned their thumbs down on Obama\u2019s decision to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees and distribute them among the states, they were sending a message. They were saying, \"We do not trust you to tell the truth. We do not trust you to screen the refugees as carefully as you say you will.\"\n\nScreening Refugees Might Not Work\n\nLet us be clear: Every governor knows this is a country of immigrants. They know we have long prided ourselves on offering generous help to the world's refugees.\n\nThey also know that the vast majority of the Syrian refugees would be honest and law-abiding. Most are simply fleeing a bloody civil war they had nothing to do with starting. Many are fleeing Islamic State, which has taken over parts of their war-torn country. They would be thrilled to get a chance at a new start in America.\u00a0\n\nEven a vast majority is not 100 percent, however. If even a few Islamic State fighters slipped in with the refugees, that could be a huge problem. The danger of that happening is worth taking seriously.\n\nHowever, Obama simply dismissed such concerns and ridiculed those who brought them up. \u201cApparently they are scared of widows and orphans coming into the United States of America,\u201d the president said. He then claimed that the screening process would be the most careful and thorough process \"conceivable.\u201d\n\nIs that so? Remember when Obama boasted how well the government's healthcare website would work? It turned out to have all sorts of serious problems. So what about refugee screening technology? Why should we assume that would work any better?\n\nUnder normal conditions, most of us would take the president\u2019s word. However, this president has misled the public so often that he has not earned the benefit of the doubt \u2014 and he is not getting it.\n\nThe governors resisting the refugee resettlement simply do not trust Obama\u2019s claim that all the refugees will be screened extremely carefully. The public does not believe the president either. Around 60 percent say they oppose the settling of Syrian refugees in their states.\u00a0\n\nA Lack Of Trust\n\nThis same president keeps trying to move prisoners from Guantanamo, Cuba, to prisons in the United States. The prisoners are all suspected of being militant Islamic fighters or their supporters. The president has repeatedly assured governors the prisoners are not a threat. He continues to make that claim even though more than 100 of those who have been released have rejoined militant groups.\n\nTo make matters worse, the government has been making ridiculous statements about the Syrian refugees.\n\nFor example, it says that only 2 percent of Syrian refugees admitted to this country since 2011 are \u201cmilitary-age males.\u201d So what? Anyone watching the news can see that many of those currently fleeing Syria are young or middle-aged men.\n\nEven if the government restricted the 10,000 refugees to \u201cwidows and orphans,\u201d widows have brothers and orphans have uncles. Wouldn\u2019t there be a need to let other family members in, to help provide for the resettled women and children? And, of course, some militant attacks have been carried out by women.\n\nHere is the point: Those who are frustrated with the refugee stalemate should be angry at the president, not the governors. Obama entered the White House determined to prove that big government can do big things well. Instead, he has increased Americans\u2019 long-held skepticism of big government.\n\nI, for one, hope the president, Congress and state governors can find a solution that will allow us to offer shelter to the refugees. The lack of trust in this case is not targeted so much at the Syrian refugees themselves. Rather, it is aimed at the White House.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Merrill Matthews is a resident scholar with the Institute for Policy Innovation in metropolitan Dallas.

The refugees are fleeing Syria's bloody civil war.\u00a0\n\nThe governors are making a big mistake, and not just because they should be helping people in need. Their behavior is actually helping Islamic State.\u00a0\n\nIslamic State, also known as ISIS, is a militant group. Its members are trying to spread their own brand of Islam throughout the Middle East. They have conquered territory in Syria and Iraq, where they are now battling both Western and Arab forces.\u00a0\n\nThe group's dream is to establish an Islamic state shaped after its own beliefs. Their fighters see themselves as being at war with the West.\n\nPlaying Into Fear\n\nThe first thing we need to understand is that Islamic State is actually weak. The group claims responsibility for many attacks it had nothing to do with, so it can appear stronger than it actually is.\n\nMost recent attacks in Western countries have actually been the acts of do-it-yourself militants unconnected to any group. But Islamic State does not want us to know that. It wants us to believe its fighters are everywhere. It wants us to be afraid.\u00a0\n\nIslamic State also\u00a0wants us to get angry and turn against Muslims everywhere. The group's fighters\u00a0want to make Muslims the enemy of the West. They believe if that happens, millions of peaceful Muslims living around the world will join them.\n\nTheir goal is quite simple. They aim to divide us. They would like nothing more than to have the Western world accept presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s ideas about tracking Muslims in the U.S. They want us to see the world in terms of us against them.\n\nIslamic State also want us to turn away Syrian and other Muslim refugees.\n\nEleven million Syrians have fled their homes since civil war broke out in 2011. More than 250,000 people have died in that war.\n\nThe fighting began as an attempt to remove Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, who many see as undemocratic and oppressive. Over time, Islamic State fighters have become increasingly involved in the war.\u00a0\n\nIslamic State also would like to see Assad gone, but its goal is not greater democracy. Instead, the group hopes to seize power for itself. Many Syrians have fled the territories the group's fighters now control, where they have introduced extremely harsh laws.\n\nThe current refugee crisis is the biggest since World War II, with Syrians now making up the world\u2019s largest refugee population. Most are struggling to find new homes in Europe, and the United States needs to help.\u00a0\n\nLiving Up To Our Ideals\n\nThe U.S. government has pledged to take in 10,000 new Syrian refugees, many of whom are fleeing Islamic State. The refugees are supposed to be distributed among the states.\n\nMany state governors are resisting these plans, however.\u00a0\n\nThe governors say they are afraid that Islamic State fighters will sneak in among the refugees. Their fear is not justified. The U.S. refugee-screening process is extremely difficult to get through. Most refugees stay in camps for months to years while their personal stories are checked.\n\nAbout half of these refugees are children, while another quarter are elderly. Almost all of the adults are either mothers or couples coming with children.\n\nThe 31 governors who are refusing to take in these war-torn refugees are not only going against our ideals as a nation. They are also helping Islamic State by dividing us even further. They are helping Islamic State by showing that our leaders want to turn away these desperate families, simply because they are Muslim.\n\nThey are also sending a message to the U.S. public that it is acceptable to fear and hate a group of people. We should not allow them to do that. Every time that kind of thing has happened in this country, we eventually realized we were wrong.\n\nLet us not forget what is written on the Statue of Liberty:\n\n\u201cGive me your tired, your poor,\n\nYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\n\nThe wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\n\nSend these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,\n\nI lift my lamp beside the golden door!\u201d\n\nCan you honestly read that and feel we should turn away these victims of Islamic State?\n\nLet us not accept this fear only to be proven wrong by history yet again. Instead, let us say no to leaders who want to fan baseless fear. Let us light the way to a safer world by doing the right and caring thing.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Don Kusler is the executive director of Americans for Democratic Action, a national liberal advocacy organization (www.adaction.org).\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers.

Recent technological advances have made it an increasingly realistic possibility. Scientists at the week's conference gathered to consider the possible repercussions of its use, and to try to hash out when and how it should be used.\n\n\"Human Enhancement\"\n\n\u201cWhen will we be prepared to say we are justified to use gene editing for human enhancement purposes?\u201d Baltimore asked.\n\nPart of the problem is defining \u201cenhancement\u201d and deciding if it would be a move in the right direction, as the word would suggest.\u00a0\n\nDoes enhancement merely refer to things like boosting muscle tone or achieving other desirable traits like perfect musical pitch? Or does the term also encompass steps to guarantee better health by preventing disease?\u00a0\n\nScientists at the week's conference disagree over whether certain types of gene-editing would be important for helping patients. One prominent researcher claimed the technology would not often be needed. Another described serious current medical needs for it.\u00a0\n\nLife-Threatening Conditions\n\nBaltimore chaired the three-day summit. He believes the determining factor in deciding whether gene editing is appropriate is whether a particular change would improve a patient's health or would merely be optional. \u201cTo my mind enhancement is really optional,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are not solving a life-threatening issue.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMaking a change to the PCSK9 gene, for example, would lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and for someone with high LDL \u2014 the bad kind of cholesterol \u2014 it could be the difference between life and death, he says. In that case the intervention would be clearly worth doing, and not simply a medically unnecessary enhancement.\u00a0\n\nWhether or not to engage in future \u201cimprovements\u201d that are considered more optional, however, is a question that remains murky.\n\nTechnology Improving Quickly\n\nTake the DEC2 gene. Tweaking it could make a person function like the rare individuals who are born with a variant that allows them to function well with just a few hours of sleep. The trait is not necessary for most people, but it could be useful for a soldier in the battlefield, for example.\u00a0\n\nUltimately, enhancements of many kinds will \u201cdefinitely\u201d happen in the future, says Fyodor Urnov of Sangamo BioSciences, a company that is now working on gene editing. The bigger question, he says, is when they will happen.\n\nThe development of cheaper, more efficient and more precise gene editing techniques is forcing researchers to consider these questions quickly. Most notably, researchers are eyeing CRISPR, short for \"clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.\" CRISPR is a powerful technology that allows editing of multiple genes at once in animal, plant and human cells.\u00a0\n\nControversy Brews\n\nCRISPR\u00a0could provide a greater understanding of the human body and help patients in need of medical care. The method has already sparked controversy, however.\n\nLast spring researchers in China announced that they had used CRISPR to alter the genomes of nonviable human embryos that could not develop into babies. The Chinese scientists concluded that the method is not yet accurate enough to be utilized in human embryos. Their experiment also appeared to introduce unexpected changes to other parts of the genome that has not been deliberately gene edited.\u00a0\n\nUltimately, the week\u2019s summit may provide some guidance on the use of both CRISPR and other older gene editing technologies. Meanwhile, the National Academies of Sciences is considering guidelines for the use of gene editing on nonhuman species.\n\nIndividual Change Vs. Future Generations\n\nAt issue during the week's conference is when and how to use gene editing on humans. Gene editing could include altering genes in one person \u2014 say to treat leukemia in one patient or make a cosmetic change. More controversially, it could also include making changes that would then alter the genome for an individual\u2019s children, grandchildren and the following generations, with potentially unknown repercussions. The latter kind of gene editing is known as\u00a0germ line editing.\n\nMost scientists at the week's meeting are enthusiastic about using gene editing to cure diseases in individual patients. However, they remain more wary of making changes that would have lasting repercussions in future generations.\u00a0\n\nYet, one prominent scientist argued that there is a real and medically sound need for germ line editing. There are patients who could be helped immensely, who cannot easily be helped by more conventional methods, he said.\n\nDo We Need Guidance Or New Laws?\n\nConsidering the range of opinions at the conference, the need for guidance on these issues is undeniable. However, guidance is not law, it is simply a set of commonly followed recommendations \u2014 which may actually be a good thing. Guidance can remain more nimble than law and it is easier to reach an agreement among scientists working in the area than among individuals who do not work in the field, Baltimore says.\u00a0\n\nThere is currently no international organization that would be an obvious fit to enforce international regulations on gene editing. In the absence of such an organization, scientists and others can look for guidance and perhaps reach agreement by considering the issues raised by earlier technologies, such as stem cell research. The specifics can then be left up to regional medical authorities to sort out.\u00a0\n\nLab scientists, patients, doctors and others will all be carefully watching what comes next.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: \"Improving\" humans with customized genes sparks debate\nBy Dina Fine Maron, Scientific American\n12.09.15\n\nEmmanuelle Charpentier of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin, Germany, speaks on a panel at the National Academy of Sciences international summit on the safety and ethics of human gene editing in Washington, D.C., Dec. 1, 2015.

Gene editing, or tweaking the human genome with additions, subtractions or alterations, is becoming increasingly realistic with modern technologies. \u201cWhen will we be prepared to say we are justified to use gene editing for human enhancement purposes?\u201d he asked.\n\nPart of the problem for researchers, doctors and ethicists alike is defining \u201cenhancement\u201d and deciding if it would be a move in the right direction, as the word would suggest. Is enhancement merely referring to boosting muscle tone and other desirable traits like achieving perfect pitch or does the term also encompass steps to guarantee better health by preventing disease? Some scientists disagreed over whether certain types of gene-editing would be important for helping patients, with one prominent researcher contending the technology would not often be needed, while another described dire current clinical needs for it. The international summit on gene editing, sponsored by Britain\u2019s Royal Society, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the US National Academies, has grappled with such thorny questions during three days of sometimes-heated discussion on editing the human genome.\n\nBaltimore, who chaired the summit, believes that when it comes to drawing the line for enhancement, the determining factor is whether the change would be optional versus therapeutic. \u201cTo my mind enhancement is really optional,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are not solving a life-threatening issue.\u201d Making a change to the PCSK9 gene, for example, would lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and for someone with high LDL \u2014 the bad kind of cholesterol \u2014 it could be the difference between life and death, he says. In that case the intervention would be therapeutic. Whether or not to engage in future \u201cimprovements\u201d that are considered more optional, however, remains murky.\n\nTake the DEC2 gene. Tweaking it could make a person function like the rare individuals who are born with a variant that allows them to function well with just a few hours of sleep. That trait is not necessary for most people, but it could be useful for a soldier in the battlefield, for example. Ultimately, enhancements of many kinds will \u201cdefinitely\u201d happen in the future, says Fyodor Urnov of Sangamo BioSciences, a company that is working in the gene editing space. The bigger question, he says, is when it will happen.\n\nCheaper, and more efficient, gene editing technology that allows scientists to manipulate the human genome with greater ease and precision than ever before is forcing researchers to consider these questions quickly. Most notably, researchers are eyeing CRISPR \u2014 short for the cumbersomely named clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. CRISPR is a powerful technology that allows editing \u2014 by way of replacing or repairing \u2014 of multiple genes at once in animal, plant and human cells. This biological dynamo could help unlock understanding of basic human biology and help patients in need of medical care. The method has also sparked new ethical controversy. Last spring researchers in China announced they used CRISPR to alter the genomes of nonviable human embryos that could not develop into babies. They discovered the method is not yet accurate enough to be utilized in human embryos and that it appeared to introduce unexpected mutations to other parts of the genome. Ultimately, the week\u2019s discourse will lead to a consensus statement providing some guidance on how to approach using this and older gene editing technologies such as zinc finger nucleases and enzymes called transcription activator-like effector nucleases, or TALENs. Meanwhile, the National Academies are working on separate studies related to how to address these questions for work in other species.\n\nAt issue is when and how to apply gene editing for research and clinical applications in humans. Gene editing could include altering genes in one person \u2014 say to treat leukemia in one patient or make a cosmetic change \u2014 but, more controversially, it could also include making changes to the germ line that would then alter the genome for an individual\u2019s children, grandchildren and the following generations, with potentially unknown repercussions.\n\nAlthough most scientists at the meeting appear enthusiastic about conducting gene editing work to cure diseases in individual patients they remain more wary of making changes to eggs, sperm or embryos that would have lasting repercussions in future generations. The former target, say, using gene editing techniques to inactivate HIV receptors and achieve resistance of blood cells to the virus (which Sangamo BioSciences is working on in clinical trials) is different than helping parents who both carry genes for Huntington\u2019s Disease to have a child that is free of the disease (a change to the genome that would be passed on to future generations and would likely not be very commonly needed).\n\nFor his part, Eric Lander from the Broad Institute said in a Dec. 1 presentation at the summit that the need to employ germ line editing would remain very, very rare thanks to other already available reproductive technologies like in-vitro fertilization that could help most people. What\u2019s more important for avoiding genetic diseases is boosting access to gene testing so people can be more aware they are carriers for disease, he said. \u201cWhat we should be thinking about is the vast majority of people with a recessive disease were not aware that they were carriers,\u201d he said. Armed with that genetic data, people could then employ existing aides like IVF or pre-implantation genetic diagnosis to conceive healthy offspring.\n\nYet at the clinical level the need for such germ line editing seems more real and arguably commonplace. George Daley of Harvard Medical School said on Dec. 1 that he and his team have seen multiple patients affected by NEMO deficiency syndrome, a disorder where an inherited faulty gene results in a weak immune system and leaves patients prone to serious infections. To care for such patients, his team has seen families that try to have a second child \u2014 sometimes nicknamed a \u201csavior sibling\u201d \u2014 in the hopes that the second child\u2019s bone marrow can be employed to help the older sibling. Yet by the time families try to conceive their second child the parents are older and that likely contributes to why they have trouble getting pregnant quickly via IVF, he says. In such instances families could save time and perhaps achieve greater success if CRISPR was on the table to help ensure a single embryo with good results, he says. The question boils down to if one should consider purely the statistics or the human, says Baltimore. But either way, even if such circumstances are rare, they still exist and cannot be ignored. Perhaps the fact that CRISPR could be performed is reason enough to leave it on the table.\n\nThe need for guidance on how to attack these issues is undeniable considering the range of opinions at the conference. But guidance is not law. That may actually be a good thing. Guidance can remain more nimble than law and it is easier to get consensus among scientists working in the area than among individuals who do not work in the field, Baltimore says. In the absence of any international body that would be an obvious fit to enforce international regulations on gene editing there are historical precedents \u2014 like stem cell research \u2014 for providing guidance and then leaving the specifics up to regional authorities. Once the consensus statement is issued, patients, lab scientists, ethicists and medical workers will be carefully watching what comes next.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "1070L": "Opinion: New technology spurs debate about when to \"edit\" human genes\nBy Scientific American, adapted by Newsela staff\n12.09.15\n\nEmmanuelle Charpentier of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin, Germany, speaks on a panel at the National Academy of Sciences international summit on the safety and ethics of human gene editing in Washington, D.C., Dec. 1, 2015.

Heredity is the set of traits that genes pass down from parent to child.\n\n\u201cWhen will we be prepared to say we are justified to use gene editing for human enhancement purposes?\u201d Baltimore asked.\n\nWhen Will It Be Needed?\n\nAn enhancement is an improvement, but it may not always be necessary, or even important. Baltimore said it is time to begin figuring out which enhancements are important enough to call for gene editing.\n\nFor example, are enhancements like boosting muscle tone or achieving perfect musical pitch important enough? Or should gene editing be reserved for preventing disease?\u00a0\n\nScientists at the conference disagree over whether certain types of gene-editing would be important for helping patients.

No, this is something far rarer and costlier. It is crushed white rhinoceros horn.\n\nFifty years ago, white rhinos were common in Africa. Today, only around 25,000 still roam the continent.\u00a0\n\nThe number of elephants left is also dropping quickly. Fifty years ago there were between 10 and 20 million elephants in Africa. Today there are just 470,000.\u00a0\n\nElephants are hunted for their hornlike tusks. Also known as ivory, tusks\u00a0are actually long, pointed teeth. They\u00a0are carved into a wide range of goods.\n\nPaying Poachers For Ivory\n\nBoth ivory and rhino horn are very popular in Asia. As a result, prices for both have soared. Elephant ivory\u00a0now sells for around $1,500 a pound. Rhino horn costs $45,000 or more.\u00a0\n\nBoth animals are supposed to be protected. However, prices have gotten so high they are hunted anyway.\u00a0\n\nSuch unlawful killing is known as poaching. In Africa, poachers and people who help them make $20 billion a year.\n\nAround 50,000 elephants were poached in 2013. There are now only about 50,000 left in all of Central Africa.\u00a0\n\nFarther east in Tanzania, the number of elephants dropped by two-thirds from 2009 to 2014. Altogether,\u00a0more than 25,000 were killed.\n\nKilling Gets Worse\n\nIn\u00a0Mozambique four out of every 10 elephants were killed\u00a0from 2009 to 2014. All of\u00a0Mozambique's\u00a0white rhinos have already been wiped out.\n\nPoaching has become a kind of warfare. Gangs of poachers carry rifles. Sometimes they even use planes.\u00a0\n\nThe killing is getting much worse. In 2007, only 13 rhinos were killed in South Africa. Last year, poachers there killed 1,215. South African rhinos may soon die out completely.\n\nIt has become much harder to protect endangered African animals. They are no longer safe even within wildlife sanctuaries. Such sanctuaries were set up to keep the animals safe from hunters. Nonetheless, poachers sneak in.\n\nKenya\u2019s Ol Pejeta sanctuary\u00a0is home to 133 rhinos. Guards must watch over it\u00a024 hours a day. There is no other way to keep poachers out.\n\nSome Good News\n\nThere is some good news, though. Last month, the Chinese and U.S. governments said they would outlaw the sale of ivory in their countries. China is the world\u2019s largest buyer of ivory.\u00a0\n\nThings are also getting better in parts of Africa. In Kenya, rhino poaching fell by nearly half last year. Fewer of the country\u2019s elephants are being killed as well.\u00a0\n\nSome of Kenya's animal sanctuaries have been trying something new. They used to try to keep people out of the sanctuaries completely. Now they are letting some people in.\u00a0\n\nFor example,\u00a0Ol Pejeta now lets herders use sanctuary land. The herders graze their cattle inside the sanctuary. In exchange, they must report poachers in the area.\n\nRefuse To Buy Ivory!\n\nThe new approach is working. Ol Pejeta has not lost an elephant in many years. Only a very few rhinos have been killed.\n\nAll of this is good news, of course. However, something else must happen if rhinos and elephants are to be saved. The demand for horns and ivory must fall.\n\nEach of us can help bring about that change. First, we must refuse to buy anything made out of ivory or rhino horn. Second, we must not take such things if they are offered to us.\u00a0\n\nOnly when people no longer want ivory and rhino horn will poaching die out. Meanwhile, elephants and rhinos are disappearing quickly.

No, this is far rarer and costlier: it is pulverized white rhino horn.\n\nKilling Animals For Cash\n\nA half-century ago, white rhinos were plentiful in Africa. Today, only around 25,000 still roam the continent, mostly in South Africa, with a handful in Namibia and Kenya. The population of elephants \u2014 another of Africa\u2019s most celebrated animals \u2014 is also dwindling fast, having fallen from 10-20 million a half-century ago to just 470,000 today.\n\nThe immediate cause of these steep declines is poaching \u2014 but the real reason is those businesspeople in Asia. Thanks to demand from people like them, the going rate for elephant tusk in Asian markets is around $1,500 per pound. Rhino horn fetches $45,000 or more. With prices like these, it is no surprise that poaching has become a $20 billion a year mega-business, even involving the political leaders of many African countries.\n\nThe World Wildlife Fund estimates that roughly 400 tons of ivory \u2014 taken from about 50,000 elephants \u2014 was trafficked in 2013. There are now only about 50,000 elephants left in all of Central Africa. Farther east, Tanzania\u2019s elephant population declined by two-thirds, or more than 25,000 animals, from 2009 to 2014. During the same time period,\u00a0Mozambique\u2019s elephant population fell by 40 percent. All of Mozambique\u2019s white rhinos have already been wiped out.\n\nLike Mechanized Warfare\n\nConservationists have been sounding the alarm for years. Despite this, the poaching industry has steadily grown. Far from a bow-and-arrow affair carried out by local tribes, it has become a kind of mechanized warfare, featuring gangs equipped with AK-47 rifles, electronic tracking gear, and sometimes even helicopters. This destruction of animal species on a\u00a0mass-scale\u00a0is enabled \u2014 indeed, encouraged \u2014 by national park authorities and government officials.\n\nThe numbers clearly illustrate this transformation. In South Africa, poachers killed 1,215 rhinoceroses last year \u2014 one every eight hours \u2014 compared to just 13 in all of 2007. At this rate, deaths will overtake births as early as next year, meaning that, for South African rhinos, extinction is not far off.\n\nThe militarization of poaching makes it increasingly difficult for conservation groups to protect animals, even within wildlife sanctuaries. For example, armed guards must patrol Kenya\u2019s Ol Pejeta Conservancy 24 hours a day to shelter the 133 rhinos living there. The herd is the largest in East Africa, and includes the world\u2019s last three northern white rhinos.\n\nChina And Kenya Join The Fight\n\nThere is reason for hope, however. Last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Barack Obama agreed to impose a near-total ban on the ivory trade. While the agreement will not be implemented overnight, it represents important progress. The ban is significant not only because China is the world\u2019s largest ivory consumer, but also because this is the first time the U.S. and China have made a joint commitment to protect wildlife.\n\nThere is also progress on the ground. In Kenya, rhino poaching fell by nearly half last year, claiming only 34 of 1,024 rhinos. In the first nine months of this year, poachers killed only six rhinos. Fewer of the country\u2019s elephants are being killed as well. In 2013, roughly 60 percent of the country\u2019s elephants died at the hands of poachers. This year, that proportion has been about one-third \u2014 a significant improvement, if hardly a pretty picture.\n\nIn Kenya, this progress can be explained partly by the need to revive tourism, which has dropped in the last two years following terror attacks. However, it may also be a response to growing global scrutiny. As Richard Vigne, the chief executive of Ol Pejeta, put it, the government \u201cgot embarrassed.\u201d\u00a0\n\nInnovative Approach Shows Results\n\nAnother major driver of progress in Kenya has been a strategic shift at the local level. Many of the country\u2019s conservancies have abandoned their old \u201cfortress mentality,\u201d which focused on keeping people out entirely, in favor of a community approach. Ol Pejeta, for example, allows herders to graze their cattle within its borders during the dry season. In exchange, the herders and their communities must report poachers in the area.\n\nThis innovative approach to policing has already produced results. Ol Pejeta has not lost an elephant in many years, and only a very few rhinos have been killed.\n\nShaming Ivory Customers\n\nAction at the international, national and community levels is of course good news. However, if poaching is to be limited to the point needed to ensure the long-term survival of Africa\u2019s rhinos and elephants, action must also be taken at the individual level. People \u2014 say, those wealthy Asian businesspeople, or their Western partners \u2014 must not only refuse to purchase products derived from poaching. They must also reject them when they are offered.\n\nFinger-pointing helped spur real action by Kenya\u2019s government. Similarly, individual shaming could help bury the pointless traditions that fuel poaching. Add to that efforts to give local communities a shared stake in saving endangered wildlife, and one has all of the elements of an effective approach \u2014 call it \u201cblame, shame, and share.\u201d With elephant and rhino populations dwindling fast, there is no time to waste in implementing it.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: Pressuring the poachers\nBy Michael Meyer, Project Syndicate\n12.08.15\n\nA white Rhino from Kube Yini Private Game Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal is captured and moved to a truck after its partner was killed by poachers near the town of Hluhluwe, South Africa, Oct. 13, 2014.

Many of the country\u2019s private conservancies (which rival its national parks in terms of wildlife) have abandoned their old \u201cfortress mentality,\u201d which prohibited human incursions, in favor of a community approach.

Today there are just 470,000 left.\u00a0\n\nElephants are hunted for their tusks. Also known as ivory, tusks\u00a0are long, pointed teeth. They\u00a0are carved into all sorts of things.\n\nBoth ivory and rhino horn are very popular in Asia. Because of that, prices have gotten very high. Elephant ivory\u00a0now sells for $1,500 a pound. Rhino horn costs $45,000 or more.\u00a0\n\nPoaching Gets Worse\n\nBoth animals are supposed to be protected. They are hunted anyway, because of those high prices.\u00a0Such killing is against the law. It is known as poaching.\u00a0\n\nAround 50,000 elephants were poached in 2013. There are now only about 50,000 left in all of Central Africa.\u00a0\n\nIn Mozambique every single white rhino has been poached. There is not one left alive.\n\nPoaching has been getting worse.

The demand for rhino horns and ivory must decrease.\n\nIndividual people have an important part to play in that change. First, they must refuse to buy products that rely on poaching.

Photo: AP/Pablo Martinez Monsivais\nPRO: U.S. must put more boots on the ground to win this war\nPresident Barack Obama has no choice. If he wants to defeat the Islamic State group, he will have to become a real war leader. He may not like it, but putting troops on the ground is the surest way to win this war.\n\nThat\u2019s nothing new. Paris was horrific, but no game-changer. The game changed in 2014, when the Islamic State broke out from Syria, drove the Iraqi military from the field and proclaimed a worldwide caliphate \u2014 a giant country ruled by Islamic law.\n\nThe moment the group, also known as ISIS, established a territorial state in Iraq, it posed two grave threats to the United States and its friends and allies.\n\nA Widening Threat\n\nA state in the heart of the Middle East controlled by Sunni extremists was guaranteed to create friction that will lead, inevitably, to a larger regional conflict with far-reaching spillover consequences. The refugees flooding Europe and Moscow\u2019s deepening of its direct involvement in the fighting in Syria foreshadow what lies ahead.\n\nThe second threat was transnational. With tens of thousands of foreign fighters and sophisticated social networking, Islamic State already had a global reach. Its conquering of territory rich in oil made it the wealthiest militant organization in history.\n\nSince then, Islamic State has demonstrated the capacity to adapt and innovate, combining the most effective terror practices developed by extremist groups over the last three decades. Nonetheless, beyond capability, what really makes the Islamic State scary is its intent.\n\nTo sustain its narrative as a true caliphate, Islamic State must live up to its image as a powerful and growing force. And the most effective way to do that is to take the battle to its enemies via transnational terror attacks.\n\nIt is folly for the administration to claim that these twin dangers \u2014 regional and transnational \u2014 are contained. They are unfolding across Europe and, most dramatically, in Paris as America watches.\n\nClearly, our strategy for dealing with the Islamic State has been insufficient. The Islamic State has been tough, absorbing months of drone attacks and light bombing.\n\nRussia\u2019s entry into the war has helped prop up\u00a0Syrian\u00a0President\u00a0Bashar Assad\u00a0and perpetuated further conflict. Still, it has not driven Islamic State from the field. While ISIS has seen some tactical reversals, like when the ethnic Kurds\u00a0recently\u00a0took back the city of Sinjar, it has bounced back from every setback.\n\nHit Islamic State In Iraq\n\nAt this point, the United States should not try to solve Syria. As long as Russia and Iran back Assad, he will stick around \u2014 as will the war against him. Moreover, it\u2019s not reasonable for the United States to lead in the fight to hit Islamic State everywhere.\n\nBut where the United States could lead is in breaking Islamic State\u2019s territorial control of Iraq \u2014 and that\u2019s a task worth doing because commanding a state is what makes the group a global threat.\n\nWithout U.S. participation, the prospects for a successful conventional war against ISIS are slim.\n\nArab states lack both the capacity and expertise to undertake these operations. The Kurds can defend themselves and even regain territory, but liberating the country is beyond them. The Iraqi military is far from ready. Neither Sunnis nor Shiite are ready to risk an all-out war with ISIS. European countries don\u2019t have the means to carry out major operations on the ground in the Middle East without the United States standing by their side.\n\nAdditionally, after conventional forces drive ISIS from the field, they will have to keep them from coming back until Iraq is politically stable enough to stand up to external security threats.\n\nThis is unwelcome news for a president who boasted of ending the war in Iraq and withdrawing U.S. troops. But the absence of U.S. boots on the ground changed the facts on the ground as well, and Islamic State was quick to take advantage.\n\nAdding force bit by bit \u2014 50 special ops troops here, a few more airstrikes there \u2014 cannot substantially alter the current unpleasant facts on the ground. The delay of meaningful ground action risks allowing the twin dangers of the extremist group to spread even farther.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: A 25-year Army veteran, James Jay Carafano is vice president of defense and foreign policy studies for The Heritage Foundation (heritage.org), a conservative think tank on Capitol Hill. Readers may write him at Heritage, 214 Massachusetts Ave. NE, Washington, D.C. 20002.\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers. Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of Tribune or Newsela.\nCON: U.S. cannot rely on force alone\nThe response to the Paris terror attacks should not be military.\n\nThe desire for revenge is understandable. French President Francois Hollande speaks of a war against the Islamic State group, just like U.S. President George W. Bush spoke of a war against al-Qaida after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States.\n\nThe threat stated by an Islamic State member, a day or two after the Paris attacks, to do something similar in Washington, D.C., only heightens the concern. It makes it seem we must do something to destroy the extremist group, which is also called ISIS.\n\nThe problem is that a military effort to destroy Islamic State is not likely to work. President Barack Obama understands that if he were to proclaim a goal of definitively eliminating ISIS in the short term, he would fail. Then he would have to eat his words.\n\nFallout From U.S. Invasions\n\nThe use of force has gotten us into the fix in which we now find ourselves. Our response to the attacks we suffered on Sept. 11 was military. Our aim in invading Afghanistan in 2001 was to stop terrorism, but we seem only to have spawned more. We did limit al-Qaida\u2019s ability to operate in Afghanistan, but they moved elsewhere, and the anger we generated may have brought even more down on us.\n\nOur invasion of Iraq in 2003 replaced a government of Sunnis led by Saddam Hussein with a government of Shiites, the majority Muslim group in Iraq. The Shiites then carried out a vendetta against the Sunnis for how Hussein had treated them.\n\nWhile occupying Iraq, we worked to weed anyone who had supported Hussein out of their jobs. That left the Sunnis thinking they had no role in the new Iraq. The exclusion of the Sunnis spawned Sunni-led armed groups like Islamic State.\n\nRabbi Michael Lerner, a philosopher and expert on the Middle East, wrote after the Paris attacks, \u201cUntil the powerful countries of the world are seen as mainly driven by a desire to care for the well-being of everyone else on the planet and the well-being of the planet itself, and care not only out of self-interest but also out of a new consciousness in which we all come to truly understand our mutual interdependence and oneness, what we saw in Paris this past week is destined to be an increasing reality in the coming decades.\u201d\n\nThe response to the Paris attacks should be to set the West on a path to dealing with the Middle East. We must do so in a way that undermines the anti-Western attitudes that lead to indiscriminate violence of the kind we saw on the streets of Paris.\n\nChanging Anti-Western Sentiment\n\nThe Paris attacks provide a new and compelling reason for the West to take action to undercut the negative sentiment about the West.\n\nAmong the various conflicts, one where we still have a chance to help is the one between Israelis and Palestinians. The lack of a solution for that conflict, which has been festering for so long, bears a direct relation to the massacre in Paris.\n\nThe support of the Western powers, and particularly the United States, of Israel was a battle cry for Osama bin Laden when he first organized al-Qaida in the 1990s.\n\nThe Arab countries were unable to deal with Israel to secure a country for the Palestinians. Bin Laden attracted the youth of the Middle East by telling them that violence was the only way to fight the West and to force Israel to accommodate the Palestinians.\n\nBin Laden successfully played on the view that the United States has been bought off by Israel to let it take over Palestinian land through its aggressive policy of building settlements on Palestinian land.\n\nPresident Obama wisely is not buying into President Hollande\u2019s thinking.\n\nRabbi Lerner\u2019s approach shows a greater chance of achieving a long-term solution. By positive policy changes, we must change the views that have generated terror attacks.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: John B. Quigley is distinguished professor of law at Ohio State University.

It is the only way to\u00a0defeat the Islamic State group. He must send U.S. troops to Syria. It is the only way to win this war.\n\nIslamic State's\u00a0attacks on Paris were horrific. It killed 130 people. It did not change the game, though. The game changed in 2014 when Islamic State broke out from Syria and defeated the Iraqi army. Now it has declared a country ruled by Islamic law. It is just starting in those two countries. It plans to take over others.\n\nThe group, also known as ISIS, is dangerous. It threatens the United States.\n\nThe Threat Of A Bigger War\n\nISIS wants its own\u00a0country in the heart of the Middle East. This will cause war. ISIS is made up of Sunni Muslims. Sunnis have one view of Islam. Shiites are the other major Muslim group. Most of the people in Iraq and Iran are Shiites.\n\nA group like ISIS would cause war in the\u00a0whole Middle East. Then problems will spread to Europe. People are already trying to escape the fighting. They are coming to Europe. At the same time, Russia is dropping bombs on several groups fighting in Syria. It could get even worse.\n\nISIS is also a threat to the world.\u00a0Islamic State already has a global reach. It has thousands of foreign fighters. It is skilled at using the Internet. It finds new fighters online. On top of that, it conquered Iraqi land. Iraq has lots of oil. Now ISIS is the richest extremist group in history.\n\nThe Islamic State must live up to its image. It wants to prove it\u00a0is a true Islamic nation.\u00a0It must make people think it is powerful and growing. The way ISIS is doing that is to take the battle to its enemies. It is using terror attacks in other countries, like France.\u00a0\n\nObama cannot say these dangers are under control. They are happening across Europe now. America is just watching it happen.\n\nOur plan for dealing with the Islamic State has been weak. The Islamic State has been tough. It has survived months of our bombing.\n\nStop ISIS From Spreading\n\nRussia has now entered the war. It is trying to prop up\u00a0Syrian\u00a0President\u00a0Bashar Assad. Its bombings have just started more fighting. Still, it has not driven the Islamic State from Syria. It is true that ISIS has suffered defeats. The ethnic Kurds\u00a0won a battle against ISIS. They took back the city of Sinjar. Yet ISIS bounces back\u00a0every time.\n\nThe United States cannot solve Syria. As long as Russia helps Assad, he will stick around. Then the war will continue. Groups like ISIS and others will keep fighting him. Also, the United States cannot fight the Islamic State everywhere.\n\nThere is one answer. The U.S. could break the Islamic State\u2019s control of Iraq. That is worth doing. Commanding a state is what makes the group so powerful.\n\nWithout the United States, the chances of beating ISIS are slim.\n\nArab countries cannot fight a war against ISIS. They do not have the troops or equipment. They do not have the ability either. The Kurds can win back territory. Beating ISIS is beyond them, though. The Iraqi military is not ready. European countries cannot fight in the Middle East on their own. They still need the United States standing by their side.\n\nIraq is weak right now. Its military cannot fight off more attacks.\n\nThis is bad news for President Obama. He boasted of ending the war in Iraq and withdrawing U.S. troops. But\u00a0ISIS moved in when we pulled out our troops.\u00a0\n\nAdding force bit by bit will not work. We send in 50 troops at a time. Then we drop a few bombs. Waiting to send in troops is risky. It could let the Islamic State spread even farther.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: A 25-year Army veteran, James Jay Carafano is vice president of defense and foreign policy studies for The Heritage Foundation (heritage.org), a conservative think tank on Capitol Hill.

French President Francois Hollande wants war against the Islamic State group. He sounds like U.S. President George W. Bush when he spoke of a war against al-Qaida right after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States.\n\nAfter the Paris attack, Islamic State threatened to attack Washington, D.C.\u00a0Now people are even more worried. Many want to attack the group, which is also known as ISIS.\n\nThere is just one problem. A war against the Islamic State is not likely to work. President Barack Obama knows that he cannot promise to destroy the Islamic State quickly. He would fail. Then he would have to eat his words.\n\nU.S. Wars Come Back To Hurt Us\n\nOur wars are what got us into this mess. We started wars after the attacks on Sept. 11. We invaded Afghanistan in 2001 to stop terrorism. Unfortunately, we only have created more. We did weaken al-Qaida in Afghanistan. But then they moved elsewhere. We angered people with our war in\u00a0Afghanistan. Now it is coming back to hurt us.\n\nOur invasion of Iraq in 2003 removed Saddam Hussein. He led a\u00a0Sunni government.\u00a0We replaced him with a government led by Shiites. They are the largest Muslim group in Iraq. The Shiites then attacked the Sunnis. They were angry about how Hussein had treated them.\n\nWhile occupying Iraq, we kicked Sunnis out of their jobs in the government. That left the Sunnis thinking they had no place in the new Iraq. Excluding the Sunnis just led to more Sunni fighters. Now we have the Islamic State.\n\nRabbi Michael Lerner is an expert on the Middle East. He says that the West must not act only in its own interests. Lerner says we must be aware that we are all connected as people.\u00a0\n\nHe said: \u201cUntil the powerful countries of the world are seen as mainly driven by a desire to care for the well-being of everyone else on the planet and the well-being of the planet itself,\u201d attacks like the ones in Paris will go on.\n\nThe response to the Paris attack should be peace. The West must make a deal with the Middle East. Then people in the Middle East will hate the West less.\u00a0\n\nHelp End The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict\n\nThe Paris attack gives us a new reason to make peace.\n\nOne way we can do this is to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That conflict has gone on for years. It may have helped cause the killings in Paris.\n\nWestern powers support Israel. The United States particularly supports Israel.\u00a0Osama bin Laden knew that. He used it to gain followers when he started al-Qaida in the 1990s.\n\nThe Arab countries were unable to get Israel to give the Palestinians their own country. Bin Laden attracted the youth of the Middle East. He told them that violence was the answer. It was the way to fight the West. Then Israel would have to give the Palestinians a country.\n\nMiddle Easterners think that the United States has been bought off by Israel.\u00a0Bin Laden played on that view.\u00a0Many in the Middle East think the United States let Israel take Palestinian land. For years, Israel has built homes on Palestinian land. All the while, the U.S. supported Israel.\n\nPresident Obama is not buying into President Hollande\u2019s thinking. He is wise. Obama knows that war in Syria will not help.\n\nRabbi Lerner\u2019s idea could achieve peace. We must change how we act in the Middle East. Then we can change the views of people who might attack us.\u00a0\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: John B. Quigley is distinguished professor of law at Ohio State University.

If he wants to defeat the Islamic State group, he\u2019ll have to become a real war leader. He may not like it, but putting troops on the ground is the surest way to win this war.\n\nThat\u2019s nothing new. Paris was horrific, but no game-changer. The game changed in 2014, when Islamic State broke out from Syria, drove the Iraqi military from the field and proclaimed a worldwide caliphate.\n\nThe moment the group, also known as ISIS, established a territorial state in Iraq, it posed two grave threats to the U.S. and its friends and allies.\n\nA Sunni extremist-controlled state in the heart of the Middle East was guaranteed to create friction that will lead, inevitably, to a larger regional conflict with far-reaching spillover consequences. The refugees flooding Europe and Moscow\u2019s deepening of its direct involvement in the fighting in Syria foreshadow what lies ahead.\n\nThe second threat was transnational. With tens of thousands of foreign fighters and sophisticated social networking, the Islamic State already had a global reach. Its acquisition of resource-rich territory made it the wealthiest militant organization in history.\n\nSince then, Islamic State has demonstrated the capacity to adapt and innovate, combining the most effective terrorist practices honed over the last three decades. Nonetheless, beyond capability, what really makes the Islamic State scary is its intent.\n\nTo sustain its narrative as a true caliphate, Islamic State must live up to its image as a powerful and growing force. And the most effective way to do that is to take the battle to its enemies via transnational terror attacks.\n\nIt is folly for the administration to claim that these twin dangers \u2014 regional and transnational \u2014 are contained. They are unfolding across Europe and most dramatically in Paris as America watches.\n\nClearly, our strategy for dealing with Islamic State \u2014 such as it is \u2014 has been insufficient. The Islamic State has been resilient, absorbing months of drone attacks and lethargic bombing.\n\nRussia\u2019s entry into the war has helped prop up Syrian President Bashar Assad and perpetuate further conflict, but has not driven Islamic State from the field. While the group has seen some tactical reversals, like the recent Kurdish assault on Sinjar, it has suffered tactical setbacks before and bounced back.\n\nAt this point, the U.S. shouldn\u2019t try to solve Syria. As long as Moscow and Tehran back Assad, he will stick around \u2014 as will the war against him. Moreover, it\u2019s not reasonable for the U.S. to lead in the fight to hit Islamic State everywhere.\n\nBut where the U.S. could lead is in breaking Islamic State\u2019s territorial control of Iraq \u2014 and that\u2019s a task worth doing because commanding a state is what makes the group a global threat.\n\nWithout U.S. participation, the prospects for a successful conventional campaign against ISIS are slim.\n\nArab states lack both the capacity and expertise to undertake these operations. The Kurds can defend themselves and even regain territory, but liberating the country is beyond them. The Iraqi military is far from ready. Neither Sunnis nor Shiite are ready to risk an all-out war with ISIS. European countries don\u2019t have the means to carry out major out-of-area operations on the ground without the U.S. standing by their side.\n\nAdditionally, after conventional forces drive ISIS from the field, they will have to keep them from coming back until Iraq is politically stable enough to stand up to external security threats.\n\nThis is unwelcome news for a president who boasted of ending the war in Iraq and withdrawing U.S. troops. But the absence of U.S. boots on the ground changed the facts on the ground as well, and Islamic State was quick to take advantage.\n\nAdding force incrementally \u2014 50 special ops troops here, a few more airstrikes there \u2014 cannot substantially alter the current unpleasant facts on the ground. Delaying meaningful ground action risks allowing the twin dangers of Islamic State to spread even farther.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: A 25-year Army veteran, James Jay Carafano is vice president of defense and foreign policy studies for The Heritage Foundation (heritage.org), a conservative think tank on Capitol Hill.

French President Francois Hollande is speaking in terms of a war against the Islamic State group, just as U.S. President George W. Bush spoke of a war against al-Qaida in 2001.\n\nThe threat stated by an Islamic State member a day or two after the Paris attacks to do something similar in Washington, D.C., only heightens the concern and makes it seem we must do something decisive to stop the extremist group, which is also called ISIS.\n\nThe problem is that a military effort to eradicate Islamic State is not likely to work. President Barack Obama understands that if he were to proclaim a goal of definitively eradicating Islamic State in the short term, he would fail and would have to eat his words.\n\nUse of force has gotten us into the fix in which we now find ourselves. Our response to the attacks we suffered on Sept. 11 was military. Our aim in invading Afghanistan in 2001 was to stop terrorism, but we seem only to have spawned more. We did limit al-Qaida\u2019s ability to operate in Afghanistan, but they moved elsewhere, and the anger we generated may have brought even more down on us.\n\nOur invasion of Iraq in 2003 replaced a Sunni-led government with a Shiite-led government that then carried out a vendetta against the Sunni population of Iraq.\n\nWhile in occupation of Iraq, we worked to weed anyone who had supported the prior regime out of government jobs. That left the Sunnis thinking they had no role in the new Iraq. The exclusion of the Sunni spawned Sunni-led armed groups like Islamic State.\n\nRabbi Michael Lerner, a philosopher and long-time student of the Middle East, has written in the wake of the Paris attack, \u201cUntil the powerful countries of the world are seen as mainly driven by a desire to care for the well-being of everyone else on the planet and the well-being of the planet itself, and care not only out of self-interest but also out of a new consciousness in which we all come to truly understand our mutual interdependence and oneness, what we saw in Paris this past week is destined to be an increasing reality in the coming decades.\u201d\n\nThe response to the Paris attack should be to set the West on a path to dealing with the Middle East in a way that undermines the anti-Western attitudes that lead to indiscriminate violence of the kind we saw on the streets of Paris.\n\nThe Paris attack provides a new and compelling reason for the West to take action to undercut the negative sentiment about the West.\n\nAmong the various conflicts, one where we still have a chance is the Israeli-Palestinian one.

It is the only way to\u00a0defeat the Islamic State group. He may not like it, but putting troops on the ground is the only way to win this war.\n\nIslamic State's\u00a0attacks on Paris were horrific. It killed 130 people. Yet the attacks did not change the game. The game changed in 2014 when Islamic State broke out from Syria and defeated the Iraqi army. Now it has declared a country ruled by Islamic law. And it is just starting in those two countries. It plans to take over others.\n\nThe group, also known as ISIS, is dangerous. It threatens the United States and its friends.\n\nAct Before It Gets Worse\n\nISIS wants its own\u00a0country in the heart of the Middle East. This will cause war. ISIS is made up of Sunni Muslims. Sunnis take a different view on Islam than Shiites, the other major Muslim group. Most people in Iraq and Iran are Shiites. Therefore, a group like ISIS would cause a conflict in the\u00a0whole Middle East. Then problems will spill over to Europe. Already refugees are flooding Europe to escape the fighting. At the same time, Russia is dropping bombs on several groups fighting in Syria. The future could be even worse.\n\nThe second threat is a worldwide one.\u00a0Islamic State already has a global reach. It has\u00a0tens of thousands of foreign fighters. It is skilled at using the Internet and social networking. On top of that, it conquered Iraqi land rich in oil. Now it is the wealthiest extremist group in history.\n\nSince then, the Islamic State has shown it can change. It is combining the terror practices developed by extremist groups over the last 30 years. Nonetheless, what really makes the Islamic State scary is its goals.\n\nTo keep up its story as a true Islamic nation, the Islamic State must live up to its image. It must make people think it is a powerful and growing force. The way ISIS is doing that is to take the battle to its enemies. Using\u00a0terror attacks across\u00a0national borders shows that it is on the move.\n\nObama cannot say these dangers are under control. They are happening across Europe now. America is just watching it happen.\n\nOur plan for dealing with the Islamic State group has not been enough. Islamic State has been tough. It has survived months of our weak attempts at bombing.\n\nBreak ISIS Control In Iraq\n\nRussia has now entered the war. It is trying to prop up\u00a0Syrian\u00a0President\u00a0Bashar Assad. It has also created more conflict. Still, it has not driven the Islamic State from Syria. It is true that ISIS has suffered defeats. The ethnic Kurds\u00a0were able to take back the city of Sinjar. Yet ISIS bounces back\u00a0every time.\n\nAt this point, the United States should not try to solve Syria. As long as Russia and Iran help Assad, he will stick around. Then the war will continue. Groups like ISIS and others will keep fighting him. Moreover, the U.S. just cannot lead in the fight to get the Islamic State everywhere.\n\nBut where the United States could lead is in breaking the Islamic State\u2019s control of part of Iraq. That is worth doing. Commanding a state is what makes the group a global threat.\n\nWithout U.S. participation, the prospects for winning a typical war against ISIS are slim. In a normal war, two military groups fight against each other on a battlefield.\n\nArab countries cannot fight a typical war against ISIS. They lack the troops, equipment and ability to beat ISIS. The Kurds can win back territory. Beating ISIS is beyond them, though. The Iraqi military is far from ready. Neither Sunnis nor Shiites are ready to risk an all-out war with ISIS. European countries do not have the ability to fight on the ground in the Middle East on their own. They still need the United States standing by their side.\n\nEven if the military defeats ISIS, they will have to keep them from coming back. Iraq is not stable enough right now. Its military cannot fight off future attacks.\n\nThis is bad news for President Obama. He boasted of ending the war in Iraq and withdrawing U.S. troops. But the lack of U.S. boots on the ground changed the facts on the ground as well. The Islamic State quickly took advantage of Obama's decision. They moved in when we pulled out troops.\n\nAdding force bit by bit will not work. We've sent in 50 troops here, and done a few airstrikes there. Waiting to send in troops is risky. It could let the Islamic State spread even farther.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: A 25-year Army veteran, James Jay Carafano is vice president of defense and foreign policy studies for The Heritage Foundation (heritage.org), a conservative think tank on Capitol Hill.

French President Francois Hollande speaks of a war against the Islamic State group. It is just like when U.S. President George W. Bush spoke of a war against al-Qaida right after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States.\n\nA day or two after the Paris attacks,\u00a0an Islamic State member\u00a0threatened to do something similar in Washington, D.C.\u00a0The threat only makes people more concerned. It makes it seem like we must do something immediately to destroy Islamic State, which is also called ISIS.\n\nThe problem is that a military effort to destroy the Islamic State is not likely to work. President Barack Obama knows that he cannot promise to destroy the Islamic State quickly. He would fail. Then he would have to eat his words.\n\nCreating More Enemies\n\nOur wars have gotten us into this fix. Our response to the attacks we suffered on Sept. 11 was military. Our aim in invading Afghanistan in 2001 was to stop terrorism. Unfortunately, we seem only to have created more. We did limit al-Qaida\u2019s ability to operate in Afghanistan, but they moved elsewhere. The anger we generated with our war in\u00a0Afghanistan\u00a0may have brought even more down on us.\n\nOur invasion of Iraq in 2003 removed the Sunni-led government of Saddam Hussein. We replaced it with a government led by the Shiite majority. The Shiites then carried out revenge attacks against the minority Sunni population of Iraq. The Shiites had suffered under Hussein.\n\nWhile occupying Iraq, we pushed anyone who had supported Saddam Hussein's government out of their jobs. That left the Sunnis thinking they had no place in the new Iraq. Excluding the Sunnis just led to Sunni groups forming, like the Islamic State.\n\nRabbi Michael Lerner is an expert on the Middle East. After the Paris attacks, he wrote that the West must not act\u00a0\"only out of self-interest\" but also out of an awareness that we are all connected as people.\u00a0\n\nHe said: \u201cUntil the powerful countries of the world are seen as mainly driven by a desire to care for the well-being of everyone else on the planet and the well-being of the planet itself ... what we saw in Paris this past week is destined to be an increasing reality in the coming decades.\u201d\n\nUndercutting Hatred Of The West\n\nThe response to the Paris attacks should be to set the West on a path to dealing with the Middle East. We must do so in a way that undermines the anti-Western feelings that lead to the violence we saw on the streets of Paris.\n\nThe Paris attacks provide a new reason for the West to take action to undercut the hatred of the West.\n\nOne way we can do this is to help solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The lack of a solution for that conflict directly relates to the massacre in Paris.\n\nThe support of the Western powers, and particularly the United States, for Israel was a battle cry for Osama bin Laden. He used it to gain followers when he first organized al-Qaida in the 1990s.\n\nThe Arab countries were unable to deal with Israel to secure a country for the Palestinians. Bin Laden attracted the youth of the Middle East. He told them that violence was the only way to fight the West and to force Israel to give the Palestinians a country.\n\nBin Laden successfully played on the view that the United States has been bought off by Israel. Many in the Middle East think the United States let Israel take over Palestinian land. For years, Israel has built settlements of homes on Palestinian land. All the while, the United States has continued to support Israel.\n\nPresident Obama wisely is not buying into President Hollande\u2019s thinking.\n\nRabbi Lerner\u2019s approach shows a greater chance of achieving long-term peace. By changing how we act in the Middle East, we can change the views that have generated terror attacks.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: John B. Quigley is distinguished professor of law at Ohio State University.

Photo: AP/Paul Sancya\nDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 In the early 1800s, a group of English textile workers known as the Luddites worried that new power looms and spinning frames would cost them their jobs. They protested by smashing the machines.\n\nToday, anxiety about new technologies is as high as ever. In the middle of a major employment crisis, some people fear that technology could cost workers millions of jobs. It is increasingly replacing workers in factories, and using computers for some legal and accounting tasks has eliminated jobs in those professions as well.\n\nRobots' Skills Versus Workers' Skills\n\nThe science of robotics is revolutionizing manufacturing. Every year, an additional 200,000 industrial robots come into use, and right now, the total number is roughly 1.5 million. One of the main challenges of our era will be to keep people working in a world of increasingly automated workplaces.\n\nYet no country can afford to ignore the transformation. Globally, some 200 million people are unemployed, up 27 million since 2008. There is a critical need to anticipate what kind of skills will be needed in the future and provide the global workforce with the education needed to find work.\n\nIn a survey, one-third of employers worldwide complained that they are unable to find workers with the right skills for job openings. Government job training programs must be strengthened, and employers and trade unions, which represent workers, must assume greater responsibility for training workers in the needed skills. They also must work more closely with educators and experts to share information about the job market, how workers are succeeding and services to help people find jobs.\n\nNo matter whether a country is rich or poor, investment in education and skills will let its workforce invent and adapt to new technologies. This kind of investment will decide whether everyone will prosper or whether many will be left behind. A large supply of workers who have been appropriately trained and can continue to learn will continue to boost the number of available jobs.\n\nProtecting Workers Is A Priority\n\nWorkers also must be protected in good times and bad. The nature of work is changing. The vast majority of workers used to have full-time jobs. Now people are increasingly finding only short-term work or temporary contracts. They are paid for working on specific projects or for a set amount of time. Many workers are forced to take part-time jobs to earn enough to live, or even must leave their country in search of a job. These trends are worsening the gap between rich and poor, as the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\n\nAs a result, policies are necessary to protect workers. Along with a strong system of unemployment benefits, programs and protections like healthcare are essential to give workers security and to ensure a healthy economy. Government programs such as pensions and social security, which give people an income in retirement, must be strengthened. Yet only 20 percent of the world\u2019s population is covered adequately by social security, and more than half the world lacks any coverage at all.\n\nThat is why the International Labor Organization (ILO), which was established in 1919, is still important today. The organization was started to protect workers' rights. In a world of increasingly automated workplaces and worsening employee-employer relationships, the ILO is more necessary than ever.\n\nLessons To Build On\n\nThe complex challenges facing workers worldwide will require complex solutions. In 2013, the ILO launched its Future of Work initiative. The plan seeks to identify and analyze job trends and begin a discussion about how to adapt to the rapidly changing labor market.\n\nOur world has changed vastly over the past century \u2013 and not only because of technology. By 2050, the global population will exceed 9 billion, and the number of people age 60 and older will have tripled. Three-quarters of the elderly will be living in what are now poorer, developing countries, and the majority of them will be women. These population changes will further revolutionize the labor market, social-security systems, economic development, and the world of employment.\n\nHuman society has made much progress since the era of the Luddites. Yet a simple truth persists: machines must strengthen, not weaken, the likelihood of prosperity for everyone. We must build on the principles of human dignity and the opportunity for decent work.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "680L": "Opinion: We love it, hate it and sometimes fear it - technology\nBy Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n11.24.15\n\nAutomated robots build a 2015 Chrysler 200 at the Sterling Heights Assembly Plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan, March 4, 2014.

The new technology wove cloth faster and cheaper than people. The weavers, who were called Luddites, were worried. They believed they would lose their jobs. The Luddites protested by smashing the new machines.\n\nToday, people are still scared about new technologies. They are especially worried about computers and robots, which are replacing workers in offices and factories. These modern machines can do many of the same things people can do. They can also perform tasks that people cannot. The robots make fewer mistakes.\n\nEvery year, 200,000 more robots begin working in factories. Right now, the total number is about 1.5 million. One of the main challenges of our time will be to keep people working.\n\nFiguring Out The Skills\n\nNo country can ignore this problem. Around the world, about 200 million people do not have jobs. That number has been rising. In 2008, just 173 million people were unemployed. There is a big need to figure out what kind of skills workers will need in the future and train them, so they can find good jobs.\n\nAround the world, businesses were asked what kind of workers they need. One out of 3 complained that there are not enough workers with the right skills. Workers must be trained and educated for the jobs of the future. Governments must figure out what skills will be needed. Then they must train people in them. Companies also must do this.\n\nThis is important for both rich and poor countries. Spending money on education and training will help workers invent and use new technologies. If countries prepare workers for these new jobs, everyone will thrive. If they do not deal with this problem, more people will become poor.\n\nMore Ways Workers Can Be Helped\n\nWorkers must be protected in good times and bad. Work itself is changing. Most people used to work full time. Now more and more people are finding only short-term work. They might work just for a month or two, for instance, or only on a project. Many workers are forced to take extra jobs to earn enough to live. Others have to leave their country to find work. This problem is making the gap between rich and poor even larger. The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer.\n\nPeople who lose their jobs need to be helped. One way is through unemployment pay. In other words, people who lose their job still receive some money to live on. Another way to help workers is with health care.\n\nWhen people stop working, they retire. Then pensions or social-security programs give them money to live on. It is very helpful as they get older.\n\nYet only 1 out of 5 people in the world get enough social security from their government. More than half the people around the world get no social security at all.\n\n\"One Simple Truth\"\n\nOur world has changed very much in one century. By 2050, there will be more than 9 billion people on Earth. Also, the number of people who are 60 and older will triple. Three-quarters of the elderly will be living in poor countries. Most of them will be women. These facts will affect jobs, social security and how people make and spend money.\n\nWe have made much progress since the Luddites. Yet one simple truth is the same. Machines must help, not hurt, people.

They protested by smashing the machines.\n\nToday, anxiety that new technologies could destroy millions of jobs is as high as ever.

Efficient paths from training and education programs to the world of work must be built, so that skills can be matched to market demand. Government programs must be strengthened, and employers and trade unions must assume greater responsibility for investing in skills. They also must consult more closely with educators and policymakers \u2013 discussions that should be informed by labor-market information, performance reviews, and the availability of employment services.\n\nWhatever a country\u2019s development level, investment in education and skills will increase the ability of its workforce to innovate and adapt to new technologies. Such investment can determine whether a country\u2019s economic growth is broadly inclusive or leaves large segments of society behind. An abundant supply of workers who have been appropriately trained and can continue to learn boosts investor confidence and thus job growth.\n\nIn addition to training the labor force for an age of further automation, sustainable economies must offer protections for workers in good times and bad. The nature of a worker\u2019s relationship with his or her employer is changing. People entering the labor market are increasingly finding only short-term or temporary contracts; often, they are forced to take informal work or emigrate for a job. These trends are exacerbating income inequality.\n\nAs a result, mitigation policies are necessary. Along with a robust system of unemployment benefits, social protections such as healthcare and pensions are essential for overall worker security and to ensure a healthy economy. And yet only 20 percent of the world\u2019s population has adequate social-security coverage; more than half lack any coverage at all.\n\nThat is why the work of the International Labor Organization, which was established in 1919, is still relevant today. In a world of increasingly automated workplaces and eroding employee-employer relationships, the values encoded in the ILO\u2019s labor standards are more necessary than ever.\n\nThe complex challenges facing workers worldwide will require complex solutions.

Photo: AP/Dave Kolpack\nLONDON, England \u2014 Drones are suddenly everywhere. The pilotless aircraft have shown up in American television thrillers like \"24\" and \"Homeland.\" They have been considered by the giant online retailer Amazon as a way to deliver packages, they have seen action in disaster zones in Haiti and the Philippines, and they have hovered menacingly over French nuclear power plants. This once secretive technology now seems to be very much out in the open and all over the place.\n\nDrones will only become more common now that policymakers in the United States and Europe have committed to giving them full access to civilian airspace. So it is more important than ever to quickly identify and address the unique challenges they present to civil liberties and privacy.\n\nDrones In The Works Are Smaller, Faster, Sneakier\n\nFor starters, drones are significantly changing the way information is collected, and in more and more new ways. Until now, most non-military drones have been equipped only with high-resolution cameras, offering police officers, search-and-rescue teams, journalists, filmmakers and inspectors of crops and infrastructure a bird's-eye view of their surroundings. However, that is about to change.\n\nManufacturers are experimenting with drones equipped with thermal cameras, which pick up body heat, allowing for night vision and the detection of hidden people or animals. They are also working on drones that will be able to recognize individuals by using facial-recognition software. In addition, some operators have become interested in using drones equipped with multiple sensors to collect so-called \u201cbig data,\" or large collections of data that can be analyzed for patterns.\n\nMeanwhile, drones are becoming smaller, allowing them to infiltrate spaces that normally would not be reachable. They can peek through windows, fly into buildings and sit, undetected, in corners or other small spaces. Their size and silence means they potentially can be used for spying, which has raised concerns about industrial espionage, sabotage and terrorism. The next drone that flies over a French nuclear power plant might be too small to be noticed.\n\nRegulation Will Be Multilayered\n\nThe price of drones is also plummeting. Already, a basic model costs no more than a few hundred dollars. Commercial operators, who want to maintain good customer relations, have an interest in using drones responsibly. Private individuals, however, are likely to have fewer reservations about using them to spy on neighbors, family members or the general public.\n\nSome action to protect privacy is necessary, but it is still not clear what is the best approach to take. Simply banning drones would deprive society of the many benefits they have to offer. There are many dangerous, dirty or dull duties they are perfectly suited for. In addition, they are much cheaper to operate and maintain than manned aircraft.\n\nThe use of drones for crop dusting, pollution monitoring or search-and-rescue operations is unlikely to raise serious concerns. Other applications, especially by police, journalists and private citizens, clearly could. The sheer variety of the technology's potential applications makes it almost impossible to regulate with one-size-fits-all legislation alone. Instead, interested parties at all levels need to carefully consider the potential impact on privacy, data protection, and ethics on a case-by-case basis.\n\nTake A Page From Closed-Circuit TV\n\nWell-meaning drone operators need to consider carefully how their activities might violate privacy and breach civil liberties. They should take steps to minimize these effects, to the best of their abilities. Government agencies, public organizations and businesses should publish guidelines on drone use, as they have done for other technologies.\n\nThe guidelines governing the use of closed-circuit televisions employed for building security purposes could serve as a good starting point.

They must be careful their drones do not harm anyone, or take away their rights.\n\nThere are laws against collecting information about someone without their permission. Such laws were written to cover things like computers, telephones and the closed-circuit TVs that security guards use to see what people are doing.

Photo: AP/Dave Kolpack\nLONDON \u2013 Drones, it seems, are suddenly everywhere. They have buzzed through the plot lines of American television thrillers like \"24\" and \"Homeland,\" been floated as a possible delivery option by the online retail giant Amazon.com, seen action in disaster zones in Haiti and the Philippines, and hovered menacingly over French nuclear power plants. This once secretive technology has become nearly ubiquitous.\n\nWith policymakers in the United States and Europe committed to opening civilian airspace to non-military drones, the pilotless aircraft will only become more common. So it is crucial that the unique challenges they present to civil liberties and privacy are quickly identified and addressed.\n\nFor starters, drones are significantly changing the way data are collected. Until now, most civilian drones have been equipped only with high-resolution cameras, offering police officers, search-and-rescue teams, journalists, filmmakers, and inspectors of crops and infrastructure a bird's-eye view of their surroundings. But that is about to change. Manufacturers are experimenting with drones that can collect thermal images, provide telecommunications services, take environmental measurements and even read and analyze biometric data. In addition, some operators have become interested in collecting \u201cbig data,\" using a range of different sensors at the same time.\n\nMeanwhile, drones are becoming smaller, allowing them to infiltrate spaces that normally would be inaccessible. They can peek through windows, fly into buildings, and sit, undetected, in corners or other small spaces. Their size and silence mean that they can be used for covert surveillance, raising concerns about industrial espionage, sabotage and terrorism. The next drone that flies over a French nuclear power plant might be too small to be noticed.\n\nThe price of drones is plummeting, too. Already, a basic model can be deployed for no more than a few hundred dollars. Commercial operators, who want to maintain good customer relations, have an interest in using drones responsibly. But private individuals are likely to have fewer scruples about using them to spy on neighbors, family members or the general public.\n\nAction is necessary. But, though the privacy implications of small, ubiquitous, low-cost drones, equipped to collect a broad range of data, are obvious, the proper response is not. Simply banning them would deprive society of the many benefits drones have to offer, from their deployment in dangerous, dirty, or dull duties to their lower operating and maintenance costs compared with manned aircraft.\n\nUsing drones for crop dusting, pollution monitoring, or most search-and-rescue operations is unlikely to raise serious concerns. But other applications, especially by police, journalists, and private citizens, clearly could. The sheer variety of the technology's potential applications makes it almost impossible to regulate with legislation alone. Instead, interested parties at all levels need to assess the potential impact on privacy, data protection and ethics on a case-by-case basis.\n\nWell-meaning drone operators need to consider carefully how their activities might violate privacy and breach civil liberties, and they should take steps to minimize these effects, using \u2013 to the best of their abilities \u2013 existing tools, such as privacy-impact assessments. Data protection authorities, civil-society organizations, and privacy officers in businesses and public organizations should publish guidance on drone use, as they have done for other existing and emerging technologies. The guidelines governing the use of closed-circuit television could serve as a good starting point \u2013 but must be supplemented to account for the different types of data a drone can collect.\n\nDrone manufacturers need to play their part as well, including by providing guidance to assist users \u2013 especially private citizens \u2013 in operating their products within the bounds of the law. Serial numbers should be included, so that drones are traceable. Civil authorities should complement these efforts by considering how existing legislation on privacy, data protection, trespassing, and harassment could be used to prosecute operators who infringe on human rights. Finally, insurance companies can provide the right incentives by exploring the market potential arising from liability in the event of misuse or accidents.\n\nThe challenge is both urgent and complex.

They have been suggested as a new way to deliver packages. They show up in the plots of American TV shows like \"24\" and \"Homeland.\" The once secret technology now seems to be very much out in the open.\n\nDrones will soon become even more common. In both the United States and Europe, they will soon be allowed to fly almost anywhere. It is more important than ever to quickly identify the serious problems they might cause.\n\nThose Nosy Drones\n\nOne main thing that makes drones both very useful and a possible threat is that they can gather all sorts of information. Much of the time that information can be gathered without a person even knowing.\n\nMost drones are already equipped with powerful cameras that offer a detailed view of their surroundings. Manufacturers are experimenting with drones that carry so-called thermal cameras. Such cameras pick up body heat, allowing for night vision and the detection of hidden people. Manufacturers are also working on drones that can recognize individual people's faces.\n\nMeanwhile, drones are becoming smaller and smaller. They can get into spaces that normally would not be reachable. They can peek through windows, fly into buildings and sit undetected in corners or other small spaces. Their size and silence means they could potentially be used for spying or sabotage. Terrorists could use them to gather information or to mount attacks. Ordinary people could use them to spy on neighbors, family members or the general public.\n\nMany Questions, Few Answers\n\nThe price of drones is dropping quickly, too. A basic model already costs no more than a few hundred dollars. Soon, almost anyone will be able to afford one.\n\nSomething must be done now to help prevent the harm drones can cause. Yet the best approach to take is still not clear.\n\nSimply banning drones is not the answer. Doing that would rob society of the many benefits they have to offer. There are many dangerous, dirty or dull jobs they are perfectly suited for. Plus drones are much cheaper to operate than manned aircraft.\n\nSome uses of drones are clearly helpful and unlikely to cause serious problems. For example, few people would object to their use in search-and-rescue operations. However, other ways of using them clearly could lead to serious violations of people's rights, among other problems.\n\nLaws Need To Match Drone Use\n\nDrone operators need to be sure they are using drones in a way that does not interfere with anyone's rights. Government agencies should publish guidelines on proper and acceptable drone use.\n\nDrone manufacturers need to play their part as well. Among other things, they should help users \u2014 especially private citizens \u2014 understand how to operate their products within the bounds of the law. Serial numbers should be included on all drones, so individual drones are traceable.\n\nVarious laws ban the collecting and storing of personal information without permission. Such laws were written for other kinds of technology but should be applied to drones as well.\n\nThere is an urgent need to regulate drone use.

They can also be very, very small.\n\nThese days, drones seem to be everywhere. They are used to find lost people. They are used to spray farmers' fields.

It's happening right now in reference to the Islamic State group's attack in Beirut, Lebanon, that happened the day before the attack in Paris. The Black Lives Matter movement has brought attention to the disproportionate amount of media coverage given to some deaths over others. The same has been said for years surrounding missing persons cases, where young white women seem to receive the most attention. Or why did everyone freak about one dead lion, when (insert serious social issue here) is happening all the time?\n\nDiscussions about what gets covered and why fill entire college courses and doctoral theses, but here's what seems clear: People are more likely to care about the tragedies they feel close to, and more likely to show their concern if everyone else is doing the same.\n\nJust think about any time a friend on Facebook passes away, said Boston College's Kelly Rossetto, who studies the intersection of grief and social media.

For those who did not spot the article's date, it seemed like another unfolding story of horror and death.\n\nIn time, it became clear to everyone that the article had been published in April. However, a disturbing thought soon occurred to many people: Facebook, Twitter and other social media had barely responded to the Kenya attack when it happened. There was no outpouring of grief and support, as there was following the attack on Paris.\n\nIn fact, this old article was clearly the first time many people were hearing about the Kenya attack.\n\nTreating News Of Horrible Events Unevenly\n\nSome people feel there is a double standard when it comes to the way we react to terrible events. Some deaths seem to matter more to us than others. News sources are a big part of this, as they decide which stories are worth reporting and which are not.\n\nThe day before Paris was attacked, Beirut, Lebanon, was also attacked. Beirut and Paris were attacked by the same extremist group, Islamic State. Also called ISIS, the group wants to start its own country under Islamic law and has taken over parts of Syria and Iraq.\n\nFacebook and Twitter barely responded to the Beirut attacks. Overall, the Beirut attacks got much less coverage in the media.\n\nFor years many in the United States have said our media treats white deaths as more important than black deaths. The same has been said about missing persons cases. Cases involving missing young white women always seem to receive the most attention.\n\nWe Care When We Feel Close To Victims\n\nWhat gets covered and why is a complicated issue. A few things seem clear, though: People are more likely to care when terrible things happen to people and places to which they feel close. They are also more likely to show their concern if everyone else is doing the same.\n\nJust think about what happens when a Facebook friend passes away. Mourners write on the person's wall and change their profile pictures to old photos of them together. They fill their status updates with \"RIP\" and \"praying for you.\" The more posts we see, the more pressure there is to post our own.\n\n\"Watching the waves of everyone else grieving can make you feel guilty,\" says social media expert Kelly Rossetto. \"If you're not changing your profile picture, if you're not posting a message,\" you start to worry that you look uncaring.\n\nParis Tugs On Americans' Hearts\n\nMany Americans have personal connections to Paris.

Some deaths seem to matter more to us than others.\n\nFor example, the city of Beirut, Lebanon, was attacked the day before Paris was attacked. It was hit by the same violent group, Islamic State. Also called ISIS, the group wants to start its own country under Islamic law and has taken over parts of Syria and Iraq.\n\nHardly anyone mentioned the Beirut attack on Facebook or Twitter.\n\nSome people think the difference is unfair, even racist. They believe it shows that Americans and other Westerners care less about people who are not Western or white.\n\nThe problem is complicated. It certainly has something to do with which stories get covered more by the news. Many people simply had not heard about the attacks in Kenya and Beirut. Perhaps that is less their fault than it is the fault of newspapers and TV, which decide which stories are most important.\n\nCaring Tied To Our Feelings Of Closeness\n\nOne thing seems clear, though. People are more likely to care when terrible things happen to people and places to which they feel close.\n\nIt is perhaps only natural that most Americans were more upset by the attack in Paris. Many Americans know Paris in a way they do not know Kenya and Beirut.\n\nAfter all, Paris is a popular vacation place for Americans and other Westerners. Even those who have never set foot in France are familiar with Paris. They have learned about it through books, TV shows and movies.\n\nAmericans Hold Paris Dear\n\nIt is that closeness to Paris that made so many Americans express their sadness and shock on Facebook and Twitter. It was almost as if a friend had died.\n\nNot many Americans have traveled to Kenya or Beirut. For that reason it is understandable that Americans did not react as much to the killings in those places. However, that does not mean it is right for us to care less.\n\nIt does not matter that we do not have vacation photos taken in Kenya or Beirut. We do not get to ignore the horrible killings in those places.\n\nDeep down, everyone knows that. Knowing it is what made so many people share an article from seven months ago. They wanted to show the world that they care about Kenya too.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In"}, {"1190L": "PRO/CON: To label, or not to label, GMO food\nBy Tribune News Service, adapted by Newsela staff\n11.13.15\n\nDemonstrators rally in favor of labeling GMO food at the Capitol in Albany, New York, April 28, 2015. Photo: AP Photo/Tim Roske\nPRO: It's all about our need to know\nHealth and food safety are controversial issues for millions of Americans \u2014 and rightly so.\n\nPolls indicate alarm over the contamination of everyday foods by pesticides, antibiotics, hormones and synthetic additives. Americans are especially concerned about genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\n\nGMOs are plant or animal products that have been re-engineered in a lab. Scientists use the DNA of bacteria, viruses or other plants and animals. The purpose is to make seeds yield more crops or make the crops heartier, more tolerant of herbicides, and resistant to insects and drought.\n\nA recent New York Times poll found that 93 percent of Americans want GMOs labeled, an action already required by 64 nations.\n\nBuying Organic Food, With Good Reason\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans believe that GMOs are unsafe. Millions of consumers are switching over to non-GMO, organic foods. As a result, organic foods have moved from a niche market into a $40 billion powerhouse.\n\nIndeed, Americans now spend more than 10 cents of every food dollar for items that are labeled \u201corganic,\u201d \u201cnon-GMO\u201d or \u201cnatural.\u201d\n\nA series of highly publicized GMO labeling ballot initiatives in California, Washington and Oregon have fueled the fires of the \u201cFrankenfoods\u201d controversy. To stop these labeling laws from passing, the big food companies like Coca-Cola and chemical companies like Monsanto, the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of genetically modified seeds, have spent vast sums of money.\n\nVermont, Maine and Connecticut have passed popular laws requiring the labeling of GMOs. In addition, eight counties in California, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii have banned GMO crops altogether.\n\nVermont\u2019s mandatory GMO labeling law goes into effect in July 2016, already causing panic among major food brands. They know they face a dilemma. One option they have is to remove all GMO ingredients from their products \u2014 which is what happened in the European Union after GMO food labeling became mandatory in 1998. Otherwise, they can add what Monsanto has called a \u201cskull and crossbones\u201d GMO label on the front of their packages and bottles.\n\nEighty percent of supermarket foods now contain GMOs and the toxic chemicals sprayed on GMOs.\n\nWHO Declares A Probable Carcinogen\n\nIn March 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) declared Monsanto\u2019s Roundup glyphosate herbicide a \u201cprobable carcinogen.\u201d\n\nThat prompted the banning of all GMO cultivation in several dozen nations, including much of Europe.\n\nIn the United States, the glyphosate herbicide currently is sprayed heavily on 84 percent of all GMO crops, including corn, soybeans, canola, sugar beets, cotton, alfalfa, wheat, beans and rice.\n\nIn California, authorities announced that Monsanto\u2019s glyphosate would be added to its list of cancer-causing chemicals requiring special monitoring and warning signs.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) previously acknowledged that long-term exposure to glyphosate can cause kidney and reproductive damage. And a report by a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last year connected glyphosate to damage done to the human gut and digestive system. It can even lead to hormone disruption, impaired liver detoxification and lowered nutrient absorption.\n\nGlyphosate use has also resulted in uncontrollable, herbicide-resistant superweeds on the majority of U.S. farmland. Meanwhile, the EPA, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have given the green light to a controversial new generation of GMO crops. These crops are allowed to be sprayed with dicamba and other strong toxicides including 2,4-D \u2014 a component of Agent Orange, the herbicide used to destroy crops and forests during the Vietnam War.\n\nBillions of pounds of glyphosate, atrazine, 2,4-D and other toxic pesticides are now being sprayed on our food to prevent pests from ruining crops. In addition, billions of pounds of highly polluting chemical fertilizers are added to help crops grow.\n\nFight For Our Right To Know\n\nThis GMO chemical onslaught is destroying our health and contaminating our soil, surface water and air.\n\nAmericans want GMO labeling. Unfortunately, Monsanto, other big food companies and the members of Congress who receive political donations from them have decided that you, the consumer, have no right to know what\u2019s in your food.\n\nIn July, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a highly unpopular bill \u2014 the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015 \u2014 taking away states\u2019 and consumers\u2019 rights to require labels on GMO foods.\n\nThe bill also makes it legal to fraudulently label GMO and chemical tainted foods as \u201cnatural.\u201d Now this bill, dubbed the DARK (Deny Americans the Right to Know) Act, goes to the Senate.\n\nAmericans can help stop passage of the DARK Act. Tell the House and Senate that you want mandatory labels on GMOs.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: A leading global food activist, Ronnie Cummins is executive director of Organic Consumers Association, a nonprofit U.S.-based network of 850,000 consumers, and the author of \u201cGenetically Engineered Foods: A Self-Defense Guide for Consumers.\u201d Readers may write him at OCA, 6771 South Silver Hill Drive, Finland, MN 55603\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers. Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of Tribune or Newsela.\nCON: It's not about food safety at all\nIt\u2019s been estimated that 70 to 80 percent of the food eaten in the United States contain ingredients that have been genetically modified. They are called genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\n\nBut labeling these foods is certainly not a food safety issue; there has never been a case of harm to people from GMO products \u2014 ever. And it\u2019s also not something that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can legally do right now, because there is no scientific difference between GMO foods and conventional foods.\n\nBy the year 2025, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) estimates that two-thirds of the world\u2019s population will confront a water shortage and ecosystems will also suffer.\n\nOne way to make this scenario less dangerous to our food supply is to promote the use of GMO foods, which reduces the need for plowing. This allows the soil to trap moisture and helps plants retain water.\n\nIn some cases, this will make the difference between a harvest or crop failure. Some results show crop yields increasing by 4 to 8 percent in arid weather. Other results suggest gains of as much as 21 percent.\n\nWith nearly 1 person in every 9 not having enough to eat on this planet, that\u2019s a promising start.\n\nLook At It This Way\n\nAnother way that GMO foods help us is that they use less pesticide. One study found that it reduced the quantity of pesticides by 37 percent and the cost by 39 percent. Although pesticides get a bad rap, the truth is that the trace amounts of pesticides that you find in the average diet are totally safe.\n\nAs one toxicologist put it, there are more carcinogens in a single cup of coffee than there are in all of the pesticide residue you consume in a year. That doesn\u2019t mean that coffee will give you cancer. It just means that human exposure to pesticides is extremely low.\n\nAn increase in yield and a decrease in pesticide costs will lower the price of our food. That\u2019s a good thing, particularly if you\u2019re not well off.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing that, after 20 years of GMO crops, there is still controversy. In fact, the manipulation of food genes is just an extension of natural plant breeding that began between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago when farmers chose the best plants to retain for planting in the following year.\n\nThe corn we eat today, for example, is the result of genetically modified plantings from thousands of years ago. Within the last few hundred years, farmers began artificially mating or cross-pollinating plants to increase yields. GMO foods are a scientific extension of this process. Modern technology just allows the process to be done to greater effect and to tackle specific problems.\n\nThat means we can produce crops that keep better and are easier to process. These crops produce foods that spoil less from mold, have fewer allergens and, ultimately, grow medicines in them.\n\nA Necessary Technology\n\nWe have already seen that with Golden Rice, a GMO food that contains beta carotene (Vitamin A) which helps to reduce blindness and prevent up to 2 million deaths annually in third-world countries.\n\nThe creators received a Patent for Humanity Award this year and received a blessing from Pope Francis in 2013.\n\nLabeling GMO products would be expensive. It could also be counterproductive by discouraging innovation in this necessary technology.\n\nWhile labels may seem like a good way to share information, the costs on manufacturers will force them to raise food prices. Many people simply cannot afford that.\n\nFor those who wish to buy non-GMO foods, there is the option to buy organic. However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that if you buy organic, you are actually putting yourself more at risk.\n\nOrganic foods are four to eight times more likely to be recalled for microbial contamination. And for that, you are paying a lot more.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Richard Williams is vice president for policy research and director of the Regulatory Studies Program at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center.

They show Americans are alarmed over what is in their food. Americans are especially worried about genetically modified organisms. They are called GMOs for short.\n\nGMOs are plant or animal products. They have been created by scientists in a lab. They use DNA from bacteria, viruses or other plants and animals. The purpose is to make better seeds. GMO seeds grow more crops. The crops keep away insects. They can also grow in low rainfall.\n\nA survey found that 9 out of 10 Americans want GMOs labeled. It is time to do it. Already, 64 countries require such labels.\n\nState Fights Over GMO Labels\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans think GMOs are unsafe. Millions of Americans are switching. They are starting to buy non-GMO, organic foods and drinks. The products are labeled \u201corganic,\u201d \u201cnon-GMO\u201d or \u201cnatural.\u201d\n\nGMO labeling laws were voted on in California, Washington and Oregon. The big food companies like Coca-Cola spent millions of dollars there. They wanted to get voters to change their minds. Chemical companies did, too. Monsanto is the world\u2019s largest maker of GMO seeds. It spent millions in those states. The companies won. They stopped the labeling laws.\n\nVermont, Maine and Connecticut did pass laws. GMO labels are required in those states.\n\nVermont\u2019s GMO labeling law starts in July 2016. Already, food brands are scared. They have to make a choice. One thing they could do is to stop using GMO ingredients in their products. That is exactly what happened in Europe. In 1998, GMO food labels became required in many countries there. Food companies in Europe stopped using GMOs.\n\nFood companies have one other choice. They could add a GMO label on their packages and bottles.\n\nEight out of every 10 foods in supermarkets contain GMOs. They also contain toxic chemicals. They are sprayed on GMO crops.\n\nPesticides Sprayed On Our Food\n\nThe World Health Organization of the United Nations (WHO) studies health problems. This year, it looked into Monsanto\u2019s Roundup herbicide. It kills weeds. It is made from glyphosate. The WHO said it probably causes cancer.\n\nThe WHO's decision caused changes in dozens of countries. Now, many stopped using GMOs in farming.\n\nIn the United States, glyphosate herbicide is sprayed on most GMO crops. Corn, wheat, beans and rice are all sprayed with it.\n\nThe U.S. government has said that glyphosate can hurt humans. It can damage major organs.\n\nGlyphosate and other pesticides are being sprayed on our food. They prevent insects from eating crops. Chemical fertilizers are added to crops, too. They help crops grow, sure. Yet they pollute the environment, too.\n\nGMO crops are destroying our health. The chemicals added to them make it worse. They also poison our soil, waters and air.\n\nCongress Looking At New Law\n\nAmericans want GMO labeling. Unfortunately, Monsanto and food companies do not want that. Lawmakers in Washington, D.C., are helping them out. They get money from these companies.\n\nRight now, Congress is talking about a new law. It would stop states from putting labels on GMO foods.\n\nThe law would also let GMO foods be labeled as \u201cnatural.\u201d This is wrong.\n\nAmericans can help stop this law from passing. Tell Congress you want labels on GMOs.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: A leading global food activist, Ronnie Cummins is executive director of Organic Consumers Association, a nonprofit U.S.-based network of 850,000 consumers, and the author of \u201cGenetically Engineered Foods: A Self-Defense Guide for Consumers.\u201d Readers may write him at OCA, 6771 South Silver Hill Drive, Finland, MN 55603\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers.

No humans have ever been harmed by them. GMO foods and regular foods are the same. There is no scientific difference between them.\n\nBy the year 2025, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) says that two-thirds of the world\u2019s people will run low on water. Growing food will become harder.\n\nGMO foods can help save our food supply. They let fields be plowed less. This allows the soil to stay moist. Then plants keep more water.\n\nGMOs help grow much more crops. Right now, 1 person in every 9 does not have enough to eat on this planet. GMO foods can help.\n\nGMOs Help, Not Hurt, Us\n\nGMO foods help in another way. One study found that they reduced the amount of pesticides by one-third. They also saved money. Pesticides get a bad rap. They do not deserve it. The truth is that there are only tiny amounts of pesticides in the foods you eat. You are totally safe.\n\nAs one scientist put it, there are more cancer-causing substances in a cup of coffee than in all the pesticides you eat and drink in a year. That does not mean that coffee will give you cancer. It just means that there are very few pesticides in what we eat and drink.\n\nFarmers grow more food through GMOs. Then the price of our food drops. That is a good thing for people who do not have much money.\n\nIt is amazing people are even fighting over GMOs. People have been changing food genes forever. GMO crops are just a newer way of doing it. Natural plant breeding began over 8,000 years ago. Back then, farmers bred plants. They chose the best ones to save for planting in the following year. The corn we eat today, for example, came from that. GMO foods just use modern technology.\n\nGMO foods also help scientists fix problems in crops. GMO crops make foods that keep better. They spoil less. They do not cause allergies. They can even grow medicines in them.\n\nTake the example of Golden Rice. It is a GMO food. It has beta carotene inside it. Also called Vitamin A, it helps to reduce blindness. It even prevents up to 2 million deaths each year in poor countries.\n\nIt Would Cost A Lot Of Money\n\nLabeling GMO products would be expensive. It could also scare away companies. They would spend less money improving GMO technology.\n\nLabels will cost food makers more. That will force them to raise food prices. Many people cannot afford that.\n\nThose who want to buy non-GM foods can buy organic. However, organic foods are not safe. Organic foods are much more likely to be contaminated with microbes. They actually put you more at risk.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Richard Williams is vice president for policy research and director of the Regulatory Studies Program at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center.

Otherwise, they can add a GMO label on the front of their packages and bottles.\n\nBanned In Europe But Not In U.S.\n\nEighty percent of supermarket foods now contain GMOs and the toxic chemicals sprayed on GMOs.\n\nIn March 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) declared Monsanto\u2019s Roundup glyphosate herbicide a \u201cprobable carcinogen.\u201d\n\nThat prompted the banning of all GMO cultivation in several dozen nations, including much of Europe.\n\nIn the United States, the glyphosate herbicide currently is sprayed heavily on 84 percent of all GMO crops. Corn, soybeans, canola, sugar beets, cotton, wheat, beans and rice are all sprayed with it.\n\nIn California, authorities announced that Monsanto\u2019s glyphosate would be added to its list of cancer-causing chemicals.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) previously acknowledged that long-term exposure to glyphosate can cause kidney and reproductive damage. And a report by a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last year connected glyphosate to damage done to the human gut and digestive system.\n\nGlyphosate use has also resulted in uncontrollable, herbicide-resistant superweeds on the majority of U.S. farmland. Meanwhile, the EPA, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have given the green light to a controversial new generation of GMO crops. These crops are allowed to be sprayed with strong toxicides including 2,4-D \u2014 a component of Agent Orange. A herbicide, Agent Orange, was used to destroy crops and forests during the Vietnam War.\n\nA Bad Bill In Congress\n\nBillions of pounds of glyphosate, atrazine, 2,4-D and other toxic pesticides are now being sprayed on our food to prevent pests from ruining crops. In addition, billions of pounds of highly polluting chemical fertilizers are added to help crops grow.\n\nThis GMO chemical onslaught is destroying our health and contaminating our soil, water and air.\n\nAmericans want GMO labeling. Unfortunately, Monsanto, other big food companies and the members of Congress who receive political donations from them have decided that you, the consumer, have no right to know what\u2019s in your food.\n\nIn July, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a highly unpopular bill, the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015. It would take away states\u2019 and consumers\u2019 rights to require labels on GMO foods.\n\nThe bill also makes it legal to fraudulently label GMO and chemical tainted foods as \u201cnatural.\u201d Now this bill, dubbed the DARK (Deny Americans the Right to Know) Act, goes to the Senate.\n\nAmericans can help stop passage of the DARK Act. Tell the House and Senate you want mandatory labels on GMOs.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: A leading global food activist, Ronnie Cummins is executive director of Organic Consumers Association, a nonprofit U.S.-based network of 850,000 consumers, and the author of \u201cGenetically Engineered Foods: A Self-Defense Guide for Consumers.\u201d Readers may write him at OCA, 6771 South Silver Hill Drive, Finland, MN 55603\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers.

They are called genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\n\nBut labeling these foods is certainly not a food safety issue. There has never been a case of harm to people from GMO products \u2014 ever. And it\u2019s also not something that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can legally do right now. It can't because there is no scientific difference between GMO foods and regular foods.\n\nBy the year 2025, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) estimates that two-thirds of the world\u2019s population will confront a water shortage. Ecosystems will also suffer.\n\nOne way to make this scenario less dangerous to our food supply is to use GMO foods. They reduce the need for plowing fields. This allows the soil to stay moist and helps plants retain water.\n\nIn some cases, this will make the difference between a harvest or crop failure. Some results show crop yields increasing by 4 to 8 percent in dry weather. Other results suggest gains as much as 21 percent.\n\nWith nearly 1 person in every 9 not having enough to eat on this planet, that\u2019s a promising start.\n\nPesticides No Cause For Fear\n\nAnother way that GMO foods help us is that they use less pesticide. One study found that it reduced the quantity of pesticides by 37 percent and the cost by 39 percent. Although pesticides get a bad rap, the truth is that the trace amounts of pesticides that you find in the average diet are totally safe.\n\nAs one toxicologist put it, there are more carcinogens in a single cup of coffee than there are in all of the pesticide residue you consume in a year. That doesn\u2019t mean that coffee will give you cancer. All it means is that human exposure to pesticides is extremely low.\n\nAn increase in yield and a decrease in pesticide costs will lower the price of food. That\u2019s a good thing, particularly if you\u2019re not well off.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing that, after 20 years of GMO crops, there is still a debate about them. In fact, the manipulation of food genes is nothing new. It's just a newer version of natural plant breeding that began between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago. Back then, farmers bred plants by choosing the best ones to retain for planting in the following year.\n\nThe corn we eat today, for example, is the result of genetically modified plantings from thousands of years ago. Within the last few hundred years, farmers began artificially mating or cross-pollinating plants to increase yields. GMO foods are a scientific extension of this process. Modern technology just allows the process to be done to greater effect and to tackle specific problems.\n\nLabels Would Discourage Innovation\n\nThanks to technology, we can produce crops that keep better and are easier to process. These crops produce foods that spoil less from mold, have fewer allergens and, ultimately, grow medicines in them.\n\nWe have already seen that with Golden Rice, a GMO food that contains beta carotene (Vitamin A) which helps to reduce blindness. It even prevents up to 2 million deaths annually in poor countries.\n\nLabeling GMO products would be expensive. It could also discourage innovation in this necessary technology.\n\nWhile labels may seem like a good way to share information, the costs on manufacturers will force them to raise food prices. Many people simply cannot afford that.\n\nFor those who wish to buy non-GMO foods, there is the option to buy organic. However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that if you buy organic, you are actually putting yourself more at risk.\n\nOrganic foods are four to eight times more likely to be recalled for microbial contamination. And for that, you are paying a lot more.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Richard Williams is vice president for policy research and director of the Regulatory Studies Program at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center.

Photo: AP Photo/Tim Roske\nPRO: Many believe GMOs unsafe, want them labeled\nHealth and food safety are scary subjects for millions of Americans. They should be.\n\nPolls show Americans are alarmed over what's in their food. Americans are worried about pesticides, antibiotics, hormones and other unnatural things added to food. They are especially concerned about genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\n\nGMOs are plant or animal products. They have been created by scientists in a lab. They use DNA from bacteria, viruses or other plants and animals. The purpose is to make seeds produce more or stronger crops. The crops can be more resistant to insects and low rainfall.\n\nA recent poll found that 93 percent of Americans want GMOs labeled. Already, 64 nations require such labels.\n\nBuying Non-GMO Food\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans believe that GMOs are unsafe. Millions of Americans are switching over to non-GMO, organic foods.\n\nIndeed, Americans now spend more on organic food. More than 10 cents of every dollar Americans spend on food and drink is for products labeled \u201corganic,\u201d \u201cnon-GMO\u201d or \u201cnatural.\u201d\n\nGMO labeling laws were voted on in California, Washington and Oregon. The big food companies like Coca-Cola spent millions of dollars to sway voters. Chemical companies did, too. Monsanto, the world\u2019s largest maker of genetically modified seeds, spent millions. They were successful in stopping these labeling laws from passing.\n\nVermont, Maine and Connecticut have passed laws requiring the labeling of GMOs.\n\nVermont\u2019s GMO labeling law goes into effect in July 2016. Already, it is causing major food brands to panic. They know they've got a problem. They have to make a choice. One option they have is to remove all GMO ingredients from their products. That's exactly what happened in European countries after GMO food labeling became required in the European Union in 1998. The other choice by food companies is to add a GMO label on the front of their packages and bottles.\n\nEighty percent of supermarket foods now contain GMOs. They also contain the toxic chemicals sprayed on GMOs.\n\nDangers Of One Herbicide\n\nIn March 2015, the World Health Organization of the United Nations (WHO) studied Monsanto\u2019s Roundup herbicide. It is made from glyphosate. The WHO said it probably causes cancer.\n\nThat prompted several dozen countries to stop the use of GMOs in farming. The state of California agrees about the danger. It added Monsanto\u2019s herbicide to its list of cancer-causing chemicals.\n\nIn the United States, glyphosate herbicide is sprayed heavily on most GMO crops. Corn, soybeans, beets, wheat, beans and rice are all sprayed with it.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has said that over time glyphosate can damage the kidney and reproductive organs of humans. And a scientific report last year connected glyphosate to damage to the human gut and digestive system.\n\nGlyphosate use has also resulted in uncontrollable, herbicide-resistant superweeds on much of U.S. farmland. Meanwhile the EPA, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have given the green light to a scary new generation of GMO crops. They are allowed to be sprayed with strong toxicides. One of these was used to destroy crops and forests during the Vietnam War.\n\nBillions of pounds of glyphosate and other toxic pesticides are now being sprayed on our food. They prevent insects from ruining crops. In addition, billions of pounds of chemical fertilizers are added to crops. They help them grow, sure. Yet they pollute the environment at the same time.\n\nOur Health Is At Risk\n\nGMOs and the chemicals used on GMO crops are destroying our health. They also poison our soil, water and air.\n\nAmericans want GMO labeling. Unfortunately, Monsanto and the other big food companies don't want that. Working with them are the members of Congress who receive money donated by those companies.\n\nRight now, Congress is considering a law. It is called the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015. It would take away the rights of states to require labels on GMO foods.\n\nThe law would also let GMO foods be labeled as \u201cnatural.\u201d This is wrong.\n\nAmericans can help stop this law from passing. Tell Congress you want labels on GMOs.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: A leading global food activist, Ronnie Cummins is executive director of Organic Consumers Association, a nonprofit, U.S.-based network of 850,000 consumers, and the author of \u201cGenetically Engineered Foods: A Self-Defense Guide for Consumers.\u201d Readers may write him at OCA, 6771 South Silver Hill Drive, Finland, MN 55603\n\nThis essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers.

GMOs can help.\n\nGMOs Mean Fewer Pesticides\n\nAnother way that GM foods help us is that they use less pesticide. One study found that it reduced the amount of pesticides and their costs by more than one-third. Pesticides get a bad rap. They don't deserve it. The truth is that there are only tiny amounts of pesticides in the foods you eat. You are totally safe.\n\nToxicologists study how chemicals affect living things. As one put it, there are more cancer-causing substances in a single cup of coffee than there are in all the small amounts of pesticides you eat and drink in a year. That doesn\u2019t mean that coffee will give you cancer. All it means is that there are very few pesticides in what we eat and drink.\n\nAn increase in crop yield and a decrease in pesticide costs will lower the price of food. That\u2019s a good thing, particularly if you don't have much money.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing people are even fighting over GMOs. They have been around for 20 years. In fact, people have been changing food genes forever. GMO crops are just a newer version of natural plant breeding that began more than 8,000 years ago.

Photo: Don Bartletti/Los Angeles Time\nBERLIN, Germany \u2013 Over the last 15 years, the bottled-water industry has grown at an explosive rate, a trend that shows no sign of slowing.\n\nIn fact, bottled water \u2013 including everything from \u201cpurified spring water\u201d to flavored water and water enriched with vitamins, minerals, or electrolytes \u2013 is the largest area of growth in the beverage industry, even in cities where tap water is safe. This has been a disaster for the environment and the world\u2019s poor.\n\nHurting Earth's Ecosystems\n\nThe environmental problems begin early on, because of where the water comes from. The bulk of bottled water sold worldwide is drawn from subterranean water reserves, many of which feed rivers and lakes. Tapping these underground water sources can worsen drought conditions.\n\nBut bottling the runoff from glaciers in the Alps, the Andes, the Arctic, the Cascades, the Himalayas, Patagonia, the Rockies, and elsewhere is not much better. It diverts that water from rivers and wetlands which help to sustain biodiversity \u2014 the variety of living things like plants, animals and organisms that inhabit a particular area of the Earth.\n\nThis has not stopped big bottlers and other investors from aggressively seeking to buy the rights to glacier water. China\u2019s booming mineral-water industry, for example, taps into Himalayan glaciers, damaging Tibet\u2019s ecosystems in the process.\n\nMaking The Drought Worse\n\nMuch of today\u2019s bottled water, however, is not glacier or natural spring water. Instead, it is processed water, which is municipal water or, more often, groundwater that has been purified. Not surprisingly, bottlers have been involved in disputes with local authorities and citizens\u2019 groups in many places over using too much water, and even their role in pollution. In drought-stricken California, some bottlers have faced protests and investigations, and one company was even banned from tapping spring water.\n\nWhat's worse, processing, bottling and shipping the water wastes a lot of resources. It takes 1.6 liters of water, on average, to package 1 liter of bottled water, making the industry a major water consumer and producer of wastewater. Processing and transportation burns fuel, causing greenhouse gasses, a significant factor in global warming.\n\nThe problems do not stop when the water reaches the consumer. The industry depends mainly on single-serve bottles made from a plastic called polyethylene terephthalate (PET) that is made out of crude oil and natural gas. In the 1990s, it was PET that turned water into a convenient, portable, lightweight product.\n\nBiggest Source Of Plastic Waste\n\nBut PET does not decompose, and, while it can be recycled, it usually is not. As a result, bottled water is now the single biggest source of plastic waste. Tens of billions of bottles end up as garbage every year. In the United States, where the volume of bottled water sold last year increased 7 percent from 2013, 80 percent of all plastic water bottles become litter, stuffing landfills.\n\nOf course, higher rates of recycling could improve this situation substantially. For example, Germany has successfully promoted recycling with a combination of smart regulations and incentives. People leave small deposits when they buy bottled water, and machines at supermarkets return these deposits in exchange for bottles, which are often brought in by the poor.\n\nSome might argue that the safety and health benefits of bottled water offset these environmental consequences. But those benefits are little more than a marketing strategy. Although tap water in Western countries occasionally has quality problems, so does bottled water. The industry\u2019s own production process sometimes causes bacteria and chemicals to contaminate the water.\n\nTap Water Often Healthier\n\nIndeed, tap water is often healthier than bottled water. Bottled water may lack fluoride, which helps prevent tooth decay. Fluoride is a mineral that is naturally present in most groundwater or is added in tiny amounts to municipal water supplies.\n\nThere are also health concerns because tiny bits of chemical compounds may leach, or escape, from PET bottles. They can also leach out of the large reusable polycarbonate water tanks used in homes and offices. Less than optimal storage conditions \u2013 which include prolonged exposure to sunlight and heat \u2013 can expose consumers to the hormone estrogen, which can alter the working of the body's endocrine system by mimicking the role of natural hormones.\n\nTo be sure, these consequences are not going unnoticed. In the United States, environmental concerns have prompted some university campuses and at least 18 national parks to ban the sale of bottled water.\n\nIt Doesn't Even Taste Better\n\nThe bottled-water industry sees the danger as well and is doing everything possible to keep public opinion on its side. To that end, big water bottlers like Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola Company are pursuing \"green\" initiatives that make bottled water seem more environmentally correct.\n\nBut make no mistake: Bottled water is adding to the world\u2019s resource and environmental challenges. It is making it harder to deliver drinkable water to the world\u2019s poor. It delivers no health benefits over clean tap water, and it does not even taste better. Indeed, taste tests reveal that people cannot tell the difference between bottled and tap water.\n\nObviously, tap water needs to change its image. Unfortunately, it lacks the marketing muscle and advertising budgets that have powered the dramatic growth of the bottled-water industry. When a product that is cheaper and better does not win, that is bad news for consumers.

Indeed, taste tests reveal that people cannot tell the difference between bottled and tap water.\n\nObviously, tap water needs to change its image. Unfortunately, tap water cannot easily advertise itself. When a product that is cheaper and better does not win, that is bad news for consumers.

Photo: Don Bartletti/Los Angeles Time\nBERLIN, Germany \u2013 Over the last 15 years, more and more people have been drinking bottled water. This move away from drinking tap water shows no sign of slowing down.\n\nIn fact, sales of bottled water are going up faster than any other kind of drink. It is true even in cities where it is safe to drink water from the faucet. This has been a disaster for the environment and for poor people.\n\nMaking Droughts Worse\n\nThe environmental problems start early. Most bottled water comes from underground water. Much of this underground water could have flowed into rivers and lakes. Using this water can make droughts worse.\n\nMany companies use water from mountain glaciers, but this is not much better. When the water melts it usually flows to areas like rivers or wetlands. When companies take glacier water, they take it from areas that need it. This has not stopped big companies that bottle water from using water from glaciers. China\u2019s bottled-water companies, for example, take water from glaciers in the Himalayan mountains. What they do damages neighboring Tibet\u2019s environment.\n\nMost of today\u2019s bottled water does not come from glaciers or natural spring water. Instead, it is water that has been treated to be safe to drink. Sometimes it is town or city water. More often, it is groundwater that has been cleaned and purified. Not surprisingly, bottled-water companies have been accused of using too much water. In California, which is in the middle of its worst drought ever, people are protesting against some bottled water companies. One company was even stopped from using spring water.\n\nWaste And Pollution\n\nAnother problem is that it takes about 1.6 liters of water to end up with one liter of bottled water. This wastes a lot of water. Also transporting the bottled water to stores burns fuel and creates pollution. It adds to the problem of climate change, which involves heating up the Earth.\n\nThe problems do not stop when the water reaches people who buy it. Water bottles are made from a plastic called polyethylene terephthalate (PET).\n\nPET does not break down and decompose in garbage dumps. Although it can be recycled, people usually do not put it in the recycle bin. As a result, bottled water is now the single biggest source of garbage from plastic. Tens of billions of bottles end up in the trash every year. In the United States, 8 out of every 10 plastic water bottles are just thrown out. That equals 80 percent of all water bottles.\n\nTap Water Often Healthier\n\nSome may say that bottled water is safer and more healthy than tap water. They may also say water safety is more important than the harmful effect on the environment. That claim is not true either. Tap water in America is not always high quality. Yet, neither is bottled water. Sometimes chemicals or bacteria get into bottled water, and companies have to destroy it.\n\nActually, tap water is often healthier than bottled water. Bottled water may lack fluoride. The mineral helps prevent tooth cavities. Fluoride is found in most groundwater and can be added in tiny amounts to tap water.\n\nTo be sure, people are paying attention to these problems. In the United States, some universities and national parks will not sell bottled water. They are concerned that bottled water harms the environment.\n\nTap Water Needs A Better Image\n\nBottled-water companies are doing everything they can to convince people that bottled water is healthy.\n\nMake no mistake, though. Bottled water adds to the world\u2019s environmental problems. It makes it harder to deliver drinkable water to poor people. It is not any healthier than clean tap water. It does not even taste better. Indeed, people cannot tell the difference between bottled and tap water.\n\nObviously, tap water needs to change how people think about it. More people need to know that tap water is safer and healthier. Unfortunately, tap water cannot advertise itself. When a product that is cheaper and better does not win, that is bad news. When the product is water, we all lose.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "590L": "Opinion: Bottled water hurts the Earth; tap water is cheap and healthy too\nBy Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n11.06.15\n\nJohn Hawk, 77, fills a jug with drinking water during his weekly visit to Big Springs at Mount Shasta, California, April 16, 2015.

Much of this water flows to rivers and lakes. When underground water is bottled it means less water for farming.\n\nBottled-water companies use water from mountain glaciers, too. This is not much better. Glaciers are huge chunks of ice. Water from glaciers is important. When they melt, the water fills rivers and streams. This has not stopped companies from using glacier water. Chinese bottled-water companies take water from glaciers in the Himalayan mountains. It hurts the environment in Tibet, which is next to China.\n\nMuch of bottled water is actually water that has been treated to be safe to drink. It has been filtered, or cleaned. Some of it comes from the water used by towns and cities. More often it comes from groundwater that was purified. California is in the middle of its worst drought ever. There has not been much rain for years. There is not enough water even for farms. Some people say that bottled-water companies are using too much water. One company was even stopped from using water from a spring.\n\nWater Is Wasted\n\nThere is another problem. It takes about 1.6 liters of water to end up with one liter of bottled water. Water is wasted when the bottling happens.\n\nThere is also still another problem. Water bottles are made from a plastic. It is called polyethylene terephthalate (PET).\n\nPET does not break down when it is thrown out. It can be recycled though. Yet people usually do not put it in the recycle bin. Billions of bottles end up in the trash every year. Eight out of 10 plastic water bottles are just thrown out.\n\nSome say that bottled water is safer and more healthy. That claim is not true either.\n\nMost Tap Water Is Healthy\n\nActually, tap water is often healthier than bottled water. Chemicals or germs can get into bottled water. Also, bottled water may not contain fluoride. The mineral helps prevent tooth cavities. Fluoride is naturally in most groundwater. It can also be added to tap water.\n\nBottled water adds to the world\u2019s problems. It is not any healthier than clean tap water. It does not even taste better.

Photo: Gina Ferazzi/Los Angeles Times/MCT\nOTTAWA, Canada \u2013 One-quarter of all the food in the world is lost each year due to inefficient harvesting, inadequate storage and waste in the kitchen. If that waste is cut in half, the world could feed an extra billion people \u2013 and make hunger yesterday\u2019s problem.\n\nThe extent of food loss is particularly shocking in view of a new global study on food security from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). According to the FAO, 57 developing countries have failed to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving the proportion of hungry people by this year. \"Developing\" is a term used to describe certain countries that are not as developed or rich as other countries. One in every 9 people on the planet \u2013 795 million in all \u2013 still goes to sleep hungry.\n\nOf course, there has also been remarkable progress. Over the last 25 years, the world has fed an extra 2 billion people and \u2013 despite the 57 countries that failed \u2013 the developing world as a whole has almost halved its hunger rate. But the challenge is to sustain the progress: by 2050, demand for food will have nearly doubled. One reason is that by then the world will have added another 2 billion mouths to feed; a second reason will be the growing appetite of a surging new middle class, as economies grow and people have more money to spend on food.\n\nWhich Targets Are On Target?\n\nAt the moment, the United Natiions is considering 169 new development targets to succeed the Millennium Development Goals. Hunger is just one target area, among many. These targets are vitally important, because they will determine how more than $2.5 trillion in development money will be spent. The issues range from climate change to malaria.\n\nMy think tank, the Copenhagen Consensus Center, works to find solutions to the world's biggest problems. Therefore, we asked 60 teams of top researchers to assess which proposed targets will do the most good \u2013 and which will not. Our research on food security shows that there are smart ways to feed many more on the planet \u2013 but they have little to do with the attempts to stop waste in rich countries.\n\nIn the rich world, the focus is on food wasted by the consumer. This makes sense: more than half of the rich world\u2019s losses take place in its kitchens (basically because we can afford it).\n\nIn Britain, for example, the greatest waste is in salads, vegetables and fruits. These are luxuries when compared with the cheap calories contained in the grains and tubers consumed throughout the developing world. Smaller households in rich countries waste more per person, because it is harder to put everything to use. Richer households add waste when they can afford to buy extra \u201cjust to be on the safe side.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, the world\u2019s hungry poor waste very little, simply because they cannot afford to. In Africa, daily food waste averages 500 calories per person but consumers account for only 5 percent of this loss. More than three-quarters of the waste occurs well before the kitchen, for example, during inefficient agriculture, when birds and rats eat crops during harvest or when pests spoil stored grain.\n\nThere are many remedies for this kind of waste \u2013 from the \u201ccuring\u201d of roots and tubers to minimize damage, to more expensive refrigeration. So why aren\u2019t these technologies \u2013 widely used in richer countries \u2013 adopted in the developing world?\n\nPut The Focus On The Farm\n\nThe answer is a lack of infrastructure. If there are no proper roads linking fields to markets, farmers cannot easily sell their surplus produce, which may then spoil before it can be eaten. Improving road and rail capacity enables farmers to reach buyers. It also enables fertilizer and other agricultural materials and tools to reach farmers. Supplying reliable electricity permits grains to be dried and vegetables to be kept cool.\n\nEconomists from the International Food Policy Research Institute estimate that the overall cost of approximately halving the amount of food lost post-harvest in the developing world would be $239 billion over the next 15 years. It would generate benefits worth more than $3 trillion, or $13 for every dollar spent.\n\nThis would make food more affordable for the poor. By 2050, better infrastructure could mean that 57 million people \u2013 more than the current population of South Africa \u2013 would no longer be at risk of hunger. Additionally, about 4 million children would no longer suffer from malnutrition.

Photo: Gina Ferazzi/Los Angeles Times/MCT\nOTTAWA, Canada \u2013 One-fourth of all the food in the world is wasted each year. If that waste is cut in half, the world could feed an extra billion people. It is time to make hunger a problem belonging to the past.\n\nToday, 1 in every 9 people on the planet still goes to sleep hungry. That number is about 795 million people. Despite the large number of hungry people in the world, there has also been much progress. Over the last 25 years, the world has fed an extra 2 billion people. Poor countries have almost cut the number of hungry people in half. However, the challenge is to continue the progress.\n\nPoor Countries Need Better Roads\n\nMany people think food waste just happens in the kitchen. In rich countries, people do throw out a great deal of food from the kitchen. Richer people can afford to throw away food they don't want to eat. In poor countries, however, people waste very little. Most of the waste happens much earlier than the kitchen. For example, it happens at the farm when birds and rats eat the crops. It can also happen when the food spoils during transportation.\n\nThere are solutions for these problems. However, these solutions are used mainly in rich countries, and not much in poor countries.\n\nI work at a research group called the Copenhagen Consensus Center. We try to find solutions to problems. We asked researchers and experts to consider the best ways to end hunger in poor countries.\n\nThey suggested two things. The first is to improve roads and transportation. If there are no proper roads connecting fields to markets, farmers cannot easily sell their extra vegetables and fruits. Therefore, the food will spoil and go to waste. Improving roads and railroads also allows fertilizer and other materials to reach farmers. These materials will improve their crops and help farmers grow more.\n\nSpending More Money On Research\n\nResearchers estimate that cutting food waste would save $239 billion over the next 15 years. This would make food much more affordable for the poor. By the year 2050, better roads could mean that 57 million people would no longer be at risk of hunger. Most of the people helped would be in the poorest countries of the world.\n\nSecondly, the researchers suggest an even better way to spend money. There should be more money spent on food research rather than just preventing food waste.\n\nToday, only $5 billion is spent each year on research to improve the seven biggest global food crops. If we increase that to $88 billion, it would save much more money later. Research can help fight disease in certain crops. It can help find ways of growing more food for less money. Food will become more plentiful and affordable for everyone. For every $1 that is spent on research, it would create $34 in benefits.\n\nHunger is a very difficult problem. It's even harder to solve when it's worsened with other problems like bad weather and wars. However, we should still try to end hunger. As I have recommended, this will take spending money on better transportation and more research on food.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "MAX": "Opinion: Wasting food in a hungry world\nBy Bjorn Lomborg, Project Syndicate\n10.28.15\n\nA couple of students throw away most of the hot meal lunch served at Washington Prep High School in Los Angeles, California, March 7, 2014. Photo: Gina Ferazzi/Los Angeles Times/MCT\nOTTAWA, Canada \u2013 One-quarter of all the food in the world is lost each year, owing to inefficient harvesting, inadequate storage and wastage in the kitchen. Halve that waste, and the world could feed an extra billion people \u2013 and make hunger yesterday\u2019s problem.\n\nThe extent of food loss is particularly galling in view of a new global study on food security from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). According to the FAO, 57 developing countries have failed to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving the proportion of hungry people by this year. One in every 9 people on the planet \u2013 795 million in all \u2013 still goes to sleep hungry.\n\nOf course, there has also been remarkable progress: over the last 25 years, the world has fed an extra 2 billion people, and \u2013 for all the 57 failures \u2013 the developing world as a whole has almost halved its hunger rate. But the challenge is to sustain the progress: by 2050, demand for food will have nearly doubled. One reason is that by then the world will have added another 2 billion mouths to feed; a second reason will be the growing appetite of a surging new middle class.\n\nAt the moment, the United Nations is considering 169 new development targets to succeed the Millennium Development Goals (hunger is one target area, among many). These targets are vitally important, because they will determine how more than $2.5 trillion in development money is spent on everything from climate change to malaria.\n\nMy think tank, the Copenhagen Consensus Center, therefore asked 60 teams of top economists to assess which proposed targets will do the most good \u2013 and which will not. Our research on food security shows that there are smart ways to feed many more on the planet \u2013 but they have little to do with the campaigns against waste seen in most of the rich world.\n\nIn the rich world, the focus is on food wasted by the consumer. This makes sense: more than half of the rich world\u2019s losses take place in its kitchens (basically because we can afford it).\n\nIn Britain, for example, the greatest waste is in salads, vegetables and fruits \u2013 luxuries when compared with the cheap calories contained in the grains and tubers consumed throughout the developing world. Smaller households in rich countries waste more per person, because it is harder to put everything to use, while richer households add waste when they can afford to buy extra \u201cjust to be on the safe side.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, the world\u2019s hungry poor waste very little, simply because they cannot afford to. In Africa, daily food waste averages 500 calories per person \u2013 but consumers account for only 5 percent of this loss. More than three-quarters of the waste occurs well before the kitchen, in inefficient agriculture, because birds and rats eat crops during harvest, for example, or pests spoil grain stores.\n\nThere are many remedies for this kind of waste \u2013 from the \u201ccuring\u201d of roots and tubers to minimize damage, to more expensive refrigeration. So why aren\u2019t these technologies \u2013 widely used in richer countries \u2013 adopted in the developing world?\n\nThe answer is a lack of infrastructure. If there are no proper roads linking fields to markets, farmers cannot easily sell their surplus produce, which may then spoil before it can be eaten. Improving road and rail capacity enables farmers to reach buyers \u2013 and fertilizer and other agricultural inputs to reach farmers. Supplying reliable electricity permits grains to be dried and vegetables to be kept cool.\n\nEconomists from the International Food Policy Research Institute estimate that the overall cost of approximately halving post-harvest losses in the developing world would be $239 billion over the next 15 years \u2013 and would generate benefits worth more than $3 trillion, or $13 of social benefits for every dollar spent.\n\nThis would make food more affordable for the poor. By 2050, better infrastructure could mean that 57 million people \u2013 more than the current population of South Africa \u2013 would no longer be at risk of hunger, and that about 4 million children would no longer suffer from malnutrition. Most of these gains would be in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the world\u2019s most deprived regions.\n\nBut there is an even better investment.

There has not been enough help for the poor countries.\n\nI work at a research center. Our work shows some ways to end hunger in poor countries. Most of these countries are in Africa and Asia.\n\nOne way is to have better roads in poor countries. Roads help farmers bring their extra vegetables and fruits to the market. If there are no roads, the food cannot get to buyers. Then the food will go to waste. Roads also allow farmers to bring soil to their fields. They can get other supplies for their farms, too. With these supplies, the farmers can grow even more food.\n\nA second way to end hunger is to do more studies. Today, about $5 billion is spent each year on food research. It is not enough money. Research can help fight disease in crops. It can help find ways of growing more food for less money. We should do research now. It can help save much more money later.\n\nHunger is a very hard problem. We should still try to end hunger though. As I have written, one way to end hunger is by building better roads.

Photo: Mitchell Prothero/McClatchy DC/TNS\nNEW YORK, N.Y. \u2013 Not long ago, I met a young girl in a refugee camp in Jordan. Like the tens of thousands of other children there, she and her family had left Syria. The country in the Middle East has faced a lot of violence. I first met her in a tent classroom near where she was sleeping. Later, I saw her again, playing with other children on a poorly built playground.\n\nI asked her where she would rather be, learning in the classroom or playing with her friends. I know what my answer would have been at her age \u2014 the playground. Still, she chose the classroom and her answer says a lot. The violence in Syria forced her to leave behind her home and friends. Her education was the one thing she could not afford to lose. She needed an education if she was ever going to get her dream. She wants to grow up and become a doctor.\n\nSchool Offers Safety And Hope\n\nI have heard that same desire for learning from so many children affected by the crisis in Syria and other emergencies around the world. Children desperately want to go to school. Their families want them to get an education.\n\nIn the middle of violence and constant change, school is a safe place. It is a place to learn, get opportunities and live a healthy life. It is a place where children can hope for the future. Education increases the chances that someday children will be able to make money. Then they can give their families a better life. Education also provides them with the skills to help the communities they are from. Once the fighting is over, it can help them forgive those who wronged them during the wars.\n\nEducation Is An Important Goal\n\nSo reaching the children affected by emergencies and giving them the chance to learn definitely helps them. It also helps their home countries. Leaders around the globe have plans. They want to start focusing on some new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals will help make good changes in poor countries across the world. Development goals help leaders work with their countries so they can be more independent, make their own money and help the people in those countries. Focusing on education is extremely important as leaders discuss these goals.\n\nThe good news is that people around the world agree that schools are important. They can help to create a more equal and stable society. The Sustainable Development Goal for education shows this. It says that everyone should be able to get an education no matter what.\n\nAs we begin working toward the new goal, there is a problem. There are so many children facing danger around the world. According to a new report by the Overseas Development Institute, nearly 1 in 3 children out of school today is living in a country affected by crisis.\n\nLots Of Children In Crisis\n\nFor the youngest children, these crises mean they never start school. For others, it means they must stop going to school and might never go back. For still others, the quality of education is poor because there are not enough well-trained teachers or school supplies. Students may not even learn basic reading or writing skills.\n\nThe number of children in danger of not going to school is higher than ever before. At the same time, money to help countries give their young people education in emergencies is very low. In 2013, out of every $100 in emergency money, only $2 of it went to education and learning opportunities. Learning is not only an important part of relief for every child in an emergency. It is also an investment in the future of their countries.\n\nMore Funds Needed For Schools\n\nOver the last few months a group has been talking about raising money for education in emergencies. Much still needs to be discussed but the idea is gaining strength. We should build on that.\n\nWe face a choice that we must make together. Should we spend more now on education, or pay the price later? If we do not pay for schools, we will have a lost generation of poorly educated children. These children will someday not have enough knowledge from school to rebuild their broken communities. They will not reach their own dreams and will find it much harder to give their own children a chance at a better life. This will cost us all in the future.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "1130L": "Opinion: Education fund needed for children fleeing countries in crisis\nBy Anthony Lake, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n10.26.15\n\nKurdish children sell snacks and gum on the street near the camp in Urfa, Turkey.

Like the tens of thousands of other children there, she and her family had fled the ever-worsening conflict in Syria. I first met her in a makeshift classroom situated in a sea of tents. Later, I saw her again, playing with other children on a poorly built playground.\n\nI asked her where she would rather be, learning in the classroom or playing with her friends. I know what my answer would have been at her age. But she chose the classroom \u2013 and her answer says a lot about what this conflict has done. Of all the things she was forced to leave behind in Syria, her education was the one thing she could not afford to lose \u2013 not if she were ever going to achieve her dream of becoming a doctor and avoid a future dictated by poverty, violence and loss.\n\nHunger For Learning\n\nI\u2019ve heard that same hunger for learning from so many children affected by the crisis in Syria and other emergencies around the world. Children desperately want to go to school. Their families desperately want them to get an education.\n\nIn the midst of violence and constant change, school is a place of learning and opportunity, a sanctuary for healing and health. It is a place where children can live a normal life and hope for the future. Education increases the chances that, someday, children will be able to support themselves and seek a better life for their families. Not only that, it also provides them with the skills to rebuild their societies. And it can give them a desire to seek reconciliation when the conflicts have been resolved and the catastrophes have ended.\n\nSo reaching the children affected by emergencies \u2013 and providing them with the opportunity to learn \u2013 helps both the children and it helps the country they are in to grow. Leaders around the globe are preparing to adopt the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that will guide development efforts for the next 15 years. Development goals help leaders better their countries so they can be more independent, make money and help the people in those countries. Focusing on education is extremely important as leaders discuss the SDGs.\n\nGoal: Universal Access To Learning\n\nThe good news is that people around the world agree that schools can help create a more equal and stable society. The proposed education Sustainable Development Goal shows this. It calls for everyone to be able to get an education no matter what their background is. They have had goals like this in the past. The Millennium Development Goal for education called for everyone to have access to primary, or elementary, school education. However, the SDG is better. It is calling for universal access to learning \u2013 from early childhood development to secondary school and beyond.\n\nAs we embrace the new education goal, we should consider one of the main obstacles to making it a reality: the rising number of emergencies around the world. According to a new report by the Overseas Development Institute, nearly 1in 3 children out of school today is living in a country affected by crisis. In the 35 countries most affected by violence, 65 million children ages 3 to 15 are at risk of missing out on learning.\n\nFor the youngest children, crisis and conflict mean that schooling never starts. For others, it means that education is interrupted, never to be restarted. For still others, the quality of education is poor because of a lack of adequately trained teachers or appropriate materials. It can be bad enough that students will not even learn basic reading or writing skills.\n\nFunding Outrageously Low\n\nSome groups face particularly serious challenges. Children with disabilities rarely even get to go to school in developing countries. In times of crisis, they are especially unlikely to get an education. And according to new data released by the Education for All Global Monitoring Report, young women living in conflict-affected areas are nearly 90 percent more likely to be out of high school or middle school than women in more stable countries. This is a huge problem, given that even a single year of additional schooling for girls increases both their earning power and the likelihood that they will send their own children to school.\n\nThough the number of children affected by crisis is reaching an all-time high, the funding to help support countries with education in emergencies remains outrageously low. In 2013, less than 2 percent of emergency aid went to education and learning opportunities. And though education is clearly a development priority, less than 10 percent of official development aid for education that year went toward children trapped in emergencies. To meet the new SDG target on education, our investments need to respond to the realities of a rapidly changing world. That begins with acceptance of a basic truth. Learning is not only a critical element of relief for every child in an emergency, but also a crucial investment in the future development of their societies. We must act on this knowledge, by securing greater and more predictable funding for education in unpredictable emergencies.\n\nPay Now, Or Pay Later?\n\nOver the last few months an informal group has been considering a proposal to establish a new global fund for education in emergencies. Though many details remain to be discussed, the idea is gaining strength and we should build on that momentum.\n\nFor we face a choice, one that we must make together: Should we spend more now on education in emergencies, or pay the price of a lost generation of poorly educated children who will someday not have enough knowledge from school to rebuild their broken societies? A generation of children who are denied the chance to reach their own dreams will find it much harder to give their own children a chance at a better future. And the long-term costs of that vicious cycle will affect us all.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "560L": "Opinion: World needs to build schools for students escaping war and crisis\nBy Anthony Lake, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n10.26.15\n\nKurdish children sell snacks and gum on the street near the camp in Urfa, Turkey.

Children want to go to school.\n\nSchools Are Safe And Healthy\n\nIn a place of violence, school is a safe place. It is a place to learn, and get a chance to live a healthy life. It is a place where children can hope for the future. Education makes it more likely that someday children will be able to make money. They can give their families a better life. School also gives them skills. They can use what they learn to help their neighbors. They can help make their communities better.\n\nIt helps to give the children affected by emergencies a chance to learn. It also helps their home countries. Leaders around the globe have plans. They want to start focusing on some new goals to help countries to grow. These goals will try to make some good changes in poor countries.\n\nPeople around the world agree that schools are important. Schools can help create a more equal society. They can decrease fighting.\n\nChildren In Danger\n\nAs we begin working toward the new goal, there is a problem. There are so many children facing danger around the world. Experts say many children out of school are living in a country having an emergency.\n\nFor the youngest children, these emergencies mean they never start school.

Students might not get school supplies.\n\nMore Money Needed For Schools\n\nThere are more children in danger of not getting to learn than ever before.

And it can instill in them a desire to seek reconciliation when the conflicts have been resolved and the catastrophes have ended.\n\nSo reaching the children affected by emergencies \u2013 and providing them with the opportunity to learn \u2013 serves both humanitarian needs and development goals. In fact, it is an area where humanitarian and development interests are almost perfectly aligned. As global leaders prepare to adopt the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that will guide development efforts for the next 15 years, this could not be more important.\n\nThe good news is that there is a growing global consensus on the centrality of schooling in breaking intergenerational cycles of inequality and building stronger, more stable societies. The proposed education SDG reflects this consensus, as it calls for inclusive, equitable access to the classroom. Unlike the Millennium Development Goal for education, which called for universal access to primary education, the SDG calls for universal access to learning \u2013 from early childhood development to secondary school and beyond.\n\nAs we embrace the new education goal, we should consider one of the primary obstacles to its achievement: the rising number of emergencies around the world. According to a new report by the Overseas Development Institute, nearly one in three children out of school today is living in a country affected by crisis. In the 35 countries most affected by violence, 65 million children from ages 3 to 15 are at risk of missing out on learning.\n\nFor the youngest children, crisis and conflict mean that schooling never starts. For others, it means that education is interrupted, never to be restarted. For still others, the quality of education is so poor \u2013 owing to a lack of adequately trained teachers or appropriate materials \u2013 that they are not acquiring even basic reading and writing skills.\n\nSome groups face particularly serious challenges. Children with disabilities \u2013 most of whom never enter school in developing countries \u2013 see their already-minimal prospects decline even further in times of crisis. And according to new data released by the Education for All Global Monitoring Report, young women living in conflict-affected areas are nearly 90 percent more likely to be out of secondary school than their counterparts in more stable countries. This is all the more problematic, given that even a single year of additional schooling for girls increases both their earning power and the likelihood that they will send their own children to school.\n\nThough the number of children affected by crisis is reaching an all-time high, financing for education in emergencies remains outrageously low. In 2013, less than 2 percent of emergency aid went to education and learning opportunities. And though education is clearly a development priority, less than 10 percent of official development aid for education that year went toward children trapped in emergencies.\n\nTo meet the new SDG target on education, our investments need to respond to the realities of a more volatile world. That begins with acceptance of a basic truth: that learning is not only a critical element of relief for every child in an emergency, but also a crucial investment in the future development of their societies. We must act on this knowledge, by securing greater and more predictable funding for education in unpredictable emergencies.\n\nOver the last few months \u2013 on the margins of the Spring Meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and at the World Education Forum in May \u2013 an informal group has been considering a proposal to establish a new global fund for education in emergencies. Though many details remain to be discussed, the idea is gaining strength. We should build on that momentum.\n\nFor we face a choice, one that we must make collectively: Should we spend more now on education in emergencies, or pay the price of a lost generation of poorly educated children who will someday be inadequately equipped to rebuild their shattered societies? A generation of children who are denied the chance to reach their own dreams will find it much harder to give their own children a chance at a better future. And the long-term costs of that vicious cycle will be borne by us all.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In", "960L": "Opinion: Refugees, children fleeing countries in crisis need more schools\nBy Anthony Lake, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n10.26.15\n\nKurdish children sell snacks and gum on the street near the camp in Urfa, Turkey. Photo: Mitchell Prothero/McClatchy DC/TNS\nNEW YORK, N.Y. \u2013 Some time ago, I met a young girl in a refugee camp in Jordan. Like the tens of thousands of other children there, she and her family had escaped the ever-worsening violence in Syria. I first met her in a cheaply constructed classroom located in a sea of tents. Later, I saw her again, playing with other children in a poorly built playground.\n\nI asked her where she would rather be, learning in the classroom or playing with her friends. I know what my answer would have been at her age \u2014 the playground. Instead, she chose the classroom \u2013 and her answer says a lot. Violence in her war-torn Middle Eastern home country forced her to leave behind her home and friends. Her education was the one thing she could not afford to lose. She needed an education if she was ever going to get her dream. She wants to grow up and become a doctor, to prevent a future controlled by poverty, violence and loss.\n\nDesperate To Go To School\n\nI\u2019ve heard that same desire for learning from so many children affected by the crisis in Syria and other emergencies around the world. Children desperately want to go to school. Their families desperately want them to get an education.\n\nIn the middle of violence and constant change, school is a safe place. It is a place to learn, get opportunities and live a healthy life. It is a place where children can hope for the future. Education increases the chances that someday children will be able to make money and give their families a better life. But it also provides them with the skills to rebuild the communities they are from. It can help them to forgive those who wronged them during the wars once the fighting is over.\n\nSustainable Development Goals\n\nSo reaching the children affected by emergencies and giving them the chance to learn definitely helps them. But it also helps their home countries. Leaders around the globe are beginning to plan. They want to start focusing on some new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals will guide some positive changes in poor countries across the world for the next 15 years. Development goals help leaders make their countries better countries so they can be more independent, make their own money and help the people in those countries. Focusing on education is extremely important as leaders discuss the SDGs.\n\nThe good news is that people around the world are beginning to agree that schools can help create a more equal and stable society. The Sustainable Development Goal for education shows this. It says that everyone should be able to get an education no matter what their background is. They have had goals like this in the past. One goal said everyone should go to primary, or elementary, school. The SDG is different. It wants to give students an education through secondary school or high school.\n\nMany Children In Crisis\n\nAs we begin working toward the new goal, we should know about a big problem that could block us from achieving it. There are many children facing danger around the world. According to a new report by the Overseas Development Institute, nearly 1 in 3 children out of school today is living in a country affected by crisis. In the 35 countries most affected by violence, 65 million children ages 3 to 15 are at risk of missing out on learning.\n\nFor the youngest children, crisis and conflict mean that schooling never starts. For others, it means that education is interrupted, never to be restarted. For still others, the quality of education is poor because of a lack of adequately trained teachers or appropriate materials. It can be bad enough that students will not even learn basic reading or writing skills.\n\nNot Enough Money\n\nThough the number of children affected by crisis is reaching an all-time high, the amount of money to help support countries with education in emergencies remains outrageously low. In 2013, less than 2 percent of emergency aid went to education and learning opportunities. To meet the new SDG goal on education, we need to respond to the realities of a rapidly changing world. Learning is not only an important part of relief for every child in an emergency, but also an investment in the future development of their societies. We must act on this knowledge, by securing greater and more predictable funding for education in unpredictable emergencies.\n\nGlobal Fund Needed\n\nOver the last few months a group has been talking about creating a global fund for education in emergencies. There is a lot that must be discussed but the idea is gaining strength. We should build on that.\n\nWe face a choice that we must make together. Should we spend more now on education, or pay the price later? If we do not pay for schools, we will have a lost generation of poorly educated children. These children will someday not have enough knowledge from school to rebuild their broken societies. They will not reach their own dreams and will find it much harder to give their own children a chance at a better life. The cost of that vicious cycle will affect us all in the future.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In"}, {"560L": "Opinion: Global warming could mean new challenges for farming\nBy Bill Gates, Project Syndicate, adapted by Newsela staff\n10.25.15\n\nSurjit Singh, 60, looks into his abandoned well that went dry, in this 2009 photo.

Photo: Rick Loomis/Los Angeles Times/MCT\nSEATTLE, Wash. \u2013 A few years ago, my wife Melinda and I visited a group of rice farmers in Bihar, India. It is a part of India that gets hit hard by floods. The farmers there were very poor. They depend on the rice they grow to feed their families. Each year, powerful monsoon rains arrive. The rivers rise higher. Farms are flooded.\n\nOften, their crops are ruined. The farmers must leave their farms. They move to the cities to find jobs to feed their families. By the next year, they return to plant again.\n\nThe visit showed us what life is like for the world\u2019s poorest farmers. They do not have the tools farmers in rich countries have. They do not have the best seeds. Poor farmers do not have fertilizer to make their plants grow. They do not have irrigation systems to water their plants.\n\nA Warming Climate Brings New Dangers\n\nNow, climate change adds a new danger. The planet is warming. Temperatures will rise in the future. Farming could be hurt. It could be worst in hot places. Some crops will not grow because of too little rain. Too much rain could wreck crops too. Insects will grow like crazy in the warmer climate and destroy crops.\n\nFarmers in rich countries will face changes, too. Yet they have the right tools. The world\u2019s poorest farmers could hurt the most.\n\nAt the same time, the world needs their help. The number of people in the world is growing quickly. The need for food will go up too. If famers cannot grow enough food, people could go hungry.\n\nThe Poorest Need The Most Help\n\nI am hopeful. I think we can handle climate change and feed the world. We must act now. Countries must develop cleaner energy. We must stop using so much coal, oil and gas. Using those fuels makes the temperature go up. Yet, it\u2019s already too late to stop some problems from hotter temperatures. That is why the poorest need help to get ready.\n\nThey will need the right tools. They need money, better seeds, fertilizer and training.\n\nOther tools are new. New seeds are being made. The seeds will grow even during droughts or flooding. The rice farmers I met in Bihar are now growing a new type of rice. They call it \u201cscuba\u201d rice. It can survive two weeks underwater. They are ready for the floods. Other types of rice are being developed to withstand drought, heat, cold and soil problems.\n\nThe Right Tools Can Make A Difference\n\nWith the right tools, farmers can grow more and make more money. The extra money can help them eat better, fix up their farms and send their children to school.\n\nI know the world has what it takes to fix this problem.

It is a part of India that gets hit hard by floods. The farmers there were very poor. They depended on the rice they grew to feed and support their families. When the big monsoon rain storms arrived each year, the rivers would swell. The farms would be threatened by floods.\n\nOften, their crops would be ruined. The farmers would flee to the cities to find jobs to feed their families. By the next year, however, they would return to plant again.\n\nThe visit showed us that life is a high-wire act for the world\u2019s poorest farmers. They don\u2019t have the things farmers in rich countries do. They don't have the best seeds, fertilizer, irrigation systems and other technologies. They also have no crop insurance, either. If they could buy insurance, they would be paid money if floods or other events wrecked their crops.\n\nNew Risks Resulting From Climate Change\n\nNow, climate change adds a new risk to their lives. Rising temperatures in the years ahead could damage agriculture. It could be worst in the hot tropics. Crops won\u2019t grow because of too little rain or too much rain. Insects will thrive in the warmer climate and destroy crops.\n\nFarmers in rich countries will experience changes, too. Yet they have the tools to manage these risks. The world\u2019s poorest farmers could suffer the most.\n\nAt the same time, the world needs their help to feed a growing population. By 2050, global food demand is expected to increase by half. Lower harvests would increase hunger. With less food, more people would slip into poverty.\n\nThe Time To Act Is Now\n\nI\u2019m hopeful. I think we can avoid the worst effects of climate change and feed the world \u2014 if we act now. Governments must spend money to develop clean energy sources that will lower greenhouse-gas emissions and halt rising temperatures. Yet, it\u2019s already too late to stop some effects of hotter temperatures. Even if the world discovered a cheap, clean energy source tomorrow, it would take time for humans to stop using coal, oil and gas. That\u2019s why the poorest need help to adapt.\n\nThey'll need the right tools. They need money, better seeds, fertilizer, training and markets where they can sell what they grow.\n\nOther tools are new and help to manage a changing climate. The Gates Foundation and its partners are developing new seeds. The seeds will grow even during drought or flooding. The rice farmers I met in Bihar are now growing a new type of rice. They call it \u201cscuba\u201d rice. It can survive two weeks underwater. They are ready for the floods. Other types of rice are being developed to withstand drought, heat, cold and soil problems.\n\nFarmers Need The Right Tools\n\nAll of these efforts could improve lives. With the right tools, farmers can often double or triple their harvests and the money they make. The extra money can help them eat better, improve their farms and send their children to school.\n\nWe cannot know all the dangers from climate change. To be prepared, we need to help smallholder farmers, who farm a small plot of land to support a single family. One of the most exciting tools to help farmers is satellite technology. In Africa, satellite images can help make soil maps. With these maps, farmers can see what crops will thrive on their land.\n\nStill, we need to get those better seeds and new technologies into their hands. A number of groups are finding ways to do just that. One Acre Fund is one of them. It helps more than 200,000 African farmers find money, tools and training. By 2020, One Acre Fund aims to reach one million farmers.\n\nMelinda and I have bet that Africa will be able to feed itself in the next 15 years.

Just one stroke of bad fortune \u2013 a drought, a flood or an illness \u2013 is enough for them to tumble deeper into poverty and hunger.\n\nNow, climate change is set to add a fresh layer of risk to their lives. Rising temperatures in the decades ahead will lead to major disruptions in agriculture, particularly in tropical zones. Crops won\u2019t grow because of too little rain or too much rain. Pests will thrive in the warmer climate and destroy crops.\n\nFarmers in wealthier countries will experience changes, too. But they have the tools and supports to manage these risks.

Declining harvests would strain the global food system, increasing hunger and eroding the tremendous progress the world has made against poverty over the last half-century.\n\nI\u2019m optimistic that we can avoid the worst impacts of climate change and feed the world \u2013 if we act now. There\u2019s an urgent need for governments to invest in new clean-energy innovations that will dramatically reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and halt rising temperatures. At the same time, we need to recognize that it\u2019s already too late to stop all of the impacts of hotter temperatures. Even if the world discovered a cheap, clean energy source next week, it would take time to kick our fossil fuel-powered habits and shift to a carbon-free future. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical for the world to invest in efforts to help the poorest adapt.\n\nMany of the tools they\u2019ll need are quite basic \u2013 things they need anyway to grow more food and earn more income: access to financing, better seeds, fertilizer, training, and markets where they can sell what they grow.\n\nOther tools are new and tailored to the demands of a changing climate. The Gates Foundation and its partners have worked together to develop new varieties of seeds that grow even during times of drought or flooding. The rice farmers I met in Bihar, for instance, are now growing a new variety of flood-tolerant rice \u2013 nicknamed \u201cscuba\u201d rice \u2013 that can survive two weeks underwater. They are already prepared if shifts in the weather pattern bring more flooding to their region. Other rice varieties are being developed that can withstand drought, heat, cold, and soil problems like high salt contamination.\n\nAll of these efforts have the power to transform lives. It\u2019s quite common to see these farmers double or triple their harvests and their incomes when they have access to the advances farmers in the rich world take for granted. This new prosperity allows them to improve their diets, invest in their farms, and send their children to school. It also pulls their lives back from the razor\u2019s edge, giving them a sense of security even if they have a bad harvest.\n\nThere will also be threats from climate change that we can\u2019t foresee. To be prepared, the world needs to accelerate research into seeds and supports for smallholder farmers. One of the most exciting innovations to help farmers is satellite technology. In Africa, researchers are using satellite images to create detailed soil maps, which can inform farmers about what plant varieties will thrive on their land.\n\nStill, a better seed or a new technology can\u2019t transform the lives of farming families until it\u2019s in their hands. A number of organizations, including a non-profit group called One Acre Fund, are finding ways to ensure that farmers take advantage of these solutions. One Acre Fund works closely with more than 200,000 African farmers, providing access to financing, tools, and training. By 2020, they aim to reach one million farmers.\n\nIn this year\u2019s Annual Letter, Melinda and I made a bet that Africa will be able to feed itself in the next 15 years. Even with the risks of climate change, that\u2019s a bet I stand by.\n\nYes, poor farmers have it tough. Their lives are puzzles with so many pieces to get right \u2013 from planting the right seeds and using the correct fertilizer to getting training and having a place to sell their harvest. If just one piece falls out of place, their lives can fall apart.\n\nI know the world has what it takes to help put those pieces in place for both the challenges they face today and the ones they\u2019ll face tomorrow.

In Africa, researchers are using satellite images to create detailed soil maps, which can inform farmers about what plant varieties will thrive on their land.\n\nCan Africa Feed Itself?\n\nStill, we need to get those better seeds and new technologies into the hands of farming families. A number of organizations, including a non-profit group called One Acre Fund, are finding ways to ensure that farmers take advantage of these solutions. One Acre Fund works closely with more than 200,000 African farmers. It provides them with access to financing, tools and training. By 2020, they aim to reach one million farmers.\n\nMelinda and I have made a bet that Africa will be able to feed itself in the next 15 years. Even with the risks of climate change, that\u2019s a bet I stand by.\n\nI know the world has what it takes to help put those pieces in place for both the challenges they face today and the ones they\u2019ll face tomorrow. Most importantly, I know the farmers do, too.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In"}, {"850L": "PRO/CON: Fixing U.S. history classes\nBy Tribune News Service, adapted by Newsela staff\n04.20.15\n\n(Center) Navil Babonayaba, 16, a student at Yuma High School, participates in her civics class in the rural farm town of Yuma in eastern Colorado, Oct. 16, 2014.

America was founded on ideas of freedom and equality \u2014 that everyone should be treated the same. Students need to learn them before they become adults.\n\nMany people blame teachers for problems in America\u2019s schools. I disagree.\n\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress is the biggest test of what American students know. It has shown that many students don't know much about U.S. history and government.\n\nThe most recent NAEP U.S. history exam was in 2010. It found just 12 percent of all U.S. high-school seniors are \u201cproficient.\u201d This is the level showing solid understanding of the questions. Only about 12 in 100 students know enough history.\n\nUnfair To Blame Teachers\n\nAmerican students perform worse on American history tests than any other subject.\n\nThen there's civics \u2014 the subject of U.S. government. The test scores there were a little better. Still, only about one-fourth of all high school seniors are \u201cproficient\u201d in civics.\n\nIt\u2019s unfair to blame America\u2019s 125,000 social studies teachers, however. I\u2019ve been with the Ashbrook Center at Ashland University in Ashbrook, Ohio, for 17 years. In that time, about 8,000 teachers from across the country have participated in our educational programs. I\u2019ve met many teachers. I know they\u2019re not the problem.\n\nThe problem is the way teachers are trained. Teachers spend too much time learning how to teach. They don't spend enough time learning what to teach.\n\nThere needs to be a major change in how teachers are taught. If not, things will get worse. Generations of students will not understand what it means to be an American. These kids will think freedom of speech is the right to take \u201cselfies.\u201d Our Founding Fathers are already thought of as dead old white men. Someday people may think they're completely unimportant.\n\nThey also may end up thinking Washington and Lincoln just have something to do with Presidents Day, a holiday for shopping. Or the Fourth of July is just a day for fireworks and a cookout.\n\nUnderstanding Our Documents\n\nTeaching government and history is more than just teaching names, dates and events. Teachers need a deep understanding of America's important documents. They need to really know the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights in the Constitution and the Emancipation Proclamation which freed slaves.\n\nU.S. history and government teachers should rely less on textbooks. Instead they should rely more on the writings and thinking of people who shaped our country.\n\nThink about civil rights. America changed its mind, heart and laws over time on the subject of racial equality. It didn\u2019t happen by accident. Important people helped change the way Americans think. That\u2019s why teachers should read the writings of those people.\n\nThis would include, for example, Frederick Douglass\u2019 1852 speech, \u201cWhat to the Slave is the Fourth of July?\u201d It would also include Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment, which ended slavery. It would also include the texts of U.S. Supreme Court decisions. Two key court decisions led to desegregation, ending the separation of black and white people. Teachers should also closely study Martin Luther King\u2019s 1963 \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\nTeachers who understand the importance of such documents and use them in the classroom will be better teachers. Their students will learn more. And they\u2019ll be better citizens as adults.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Roger L. Beckett is executive director of the Ashbrook Center at Ashland University, Ashland, Ohio.

It's necessary to understand what's happening in our nation and around the world.\n\nHowever, high school schedules are already crowded with classes. Stuffing in more American history and civics classes won't fix anything. Civics is the study of how government works.\n\nBeefing up those areas in high schools could mean forcing even more information upon our kids. The U.S. Department of Education and state education departments already do a bad job deciding what students must learn.\n\nTeaching teenagers to be better citizens should be left to parents and local schools. Even community groups such as the Boy or Girl Scouts of America and the Rotary Club would do a better job than government agencies.\n\nA System Of Government\n\nInstead, history and government courses are too often taught in public schools as a series of crimes by the U.S. They'll describe what the government has done to Native Americans, Mexicans, African-Americans, immigrants and women.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. Schools should teach about the mistakes our government makes. But we should also recognize that our founders were wise men.\n\nThey created a system of government that corrects its mistakes. Sometimes it is late to do it, but our country has continued to correct past mistakes over its 239-year history. It leads to a better nation.\n\nOur students are already restless. Forcing more American history and civics classes on them will probably make things worse. If they're developed by our leaders in Washington then they'll be even worse.\n\nOne example is the community service required of students in most public school districts.\n\nThe requirement violates our right of individual freedom in the Constitution. It forces students to spend many hours each month away from the classroom. They have to do public service projects like recycling and cleaning up trash in poor neighborhoods. Some even are being made to attend re-education classes to make sure they are learning liberal ideas.\n\nMaking Things Worse\n\nNow there\u2019s even a push to make all high school seniors take the same citizenship test immigrants take. But why? Nearly all high school students spend a semester studying civics. In addition, most spend a year studying American history.\n\nPeter Levine of Boston\u2019s Tufts University believes that making students take a citizenship exam will reduce the amount of civic education in our schools. He also believes it will make civics classes worse.\n\nWe already teach enough civics. \"The problem is that civics is often viewed as a set of disconnected facts,\" he said. It is not taught as \"a challenging and inspiring subject that will continue to interest us after high school.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right. And that\u2019s exactly why school programs for American history should be created locally. It should be decided in towns and cities, not by our national government.\n\nI live in the Baltimore area. Our local history is even more fascinating when linked to the nation's history.\n\nConsider just a few famous Baltimore events: the discovery of Chesapeake Bay by Captain John Smith; the building of the Baltimore railroad that allowed pioneers to head west; the bombardment of Fort McHenry during the War of 1812 that inspired the National Anthem; and the part Baltimore played in the Civil War. And on and on.\n\nUsed across the U.S., this approach can make history come alive.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Whitt Flora, an independent journalist, is a former chief congressional correspondent for Aviation & Space Technology Magazine and a former White House correspondent for the Columbus Dispatch.

And the shortcomings should be obvious.\n\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress has shown consistently that many students, in the fields of U.S. history and government, among others, are not even mastering the basics.\n\nFor example, the most recent NAEP U.S. history exam, in 2010, found just 12 percent of all U.S. high school seniors scoring at or above the \u201cproficient\u201d level.

Still, slightly less than one-fourth of all high school seniors performed at or above the \u201cproficient\u201d level.\n\nA Problem With Training\n\nWe often hear about the need to improve education in the STEM subjects of science, technology, engineering and math. But American students perform worse on American history tests than in any other subject.\n\nIt\u2019s unfair to blame America\u2019s 125,000 social studies teachers, however.

We'll continue to raise generation after generation of students who do not understand what it means to be an American, who equate freedom of speech with \u201cselfies,\u201d who believe freedom of religion requires purging religion from the public square, who think our Founding Fathers \u2014 belittled in popular culture as dead old white men \u2014 are irrelevant.\n\nThey also may end up thinking of Sam Adams solely as a beer company. Or associate Washington and Lincoln as having something to do with Presidents Day, a holiday when everybody goes shopping. Or The Fourth of July merely as an occasion for fireworks and a cookout.\n\nMore Than Chronology\n\nTeaching government and history involves more than just stringing together an agreed-upon chronology of significant dates and events and connecting them with names. It involves more than superficial familiarity with a handful of historically significant documents, such as the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights and Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nTo successfully teach U.S. history and government, so students understand and appreciate the principles that define our American character, teachers need to rely less on textbooks. Instead they should rely more on the writings and thinking of those who shaped our country.\n\nConsider civil rights. The changes in America\u2019s mind, heart and laws over time on the subject of racial equality didn\u2019t happen by accident. That\u2019s why we urge \u2014 and in our master\u2019s degree program require \u2014 teachers to immerse themselves in the writings of those who shaped America\u2019s thinking.\n\nThis would include, for example, Frederick Douglass\u2019 1852 speech, \u201cWhat to the Slave is the Fourth of July?\u201d along with Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation, Gettysburg Address and \u201cResolution Submitting the Thirteenth Amendment (outlawing slavery) to the States,\u201d the texts of the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) and Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954), and Martin Luther King\u2019s 1963 \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\nTeachers who understand the importance of such documents and use them in the classroom will be better teachers.

Or The Fourth of July might just be considered a good time for fireworks and a cookout.\n\nRely On Writings And Thinking\n\nTeaching government and history involves more than just significant dates and events and connecting them with names. It involves more than a basic familiarity with a handful of historically significant documents, such as the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights and Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nTo successfully teach U.S. history and government teachers need to rely less on textbooks. Instead, they should rely more on the writings and thinking of those who shaped our country.\n\nConsider civil rights. The changes in America\u2019s mind, heart and laws over time on the subject of racial equality didn\u2019t happen by accident. That\u2019s why we urge teachers to deeply read the writings of those people who shaped America\u2019s thinking.\n\nThis would include, for example, Frederick Douglass\u2019 1852 speech, \u201cWhat to the Slave is the Fourth of July?\u201d It would also include Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation, Gettysburg Address and \u201cResolution Submitting the Thirteenth Amendment (outlawing slavery) to the States.\u201d It would include the texts of the U.S. Supreme Court decisions regarding desegregation in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) and Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954). Teachers should also have a deep understanding of Martin Luther King\u2019s 1963 \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\nTeachers who understand the importance of such documents and use them in the classroom will be better teachers. Their students will learn more. And they\u2019ll be better prepared for the responsibilities of citizenship as adults.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Roger L.

That basic information is necessary to fully understand what happens in our nation and around the world.\n\nHowever, high school schedules are already crowded with classes. Stuffing in more American history and civics classes is exactly the wrong way to accomplish that mission.\n\nBeefing up those areas in the nation\u2019s high schools likely would mean even more force-feeding our nation\u2019s youth. They're already swallowing a politically correct diet of information decided upon by agencies like the U.S. Department of Education and state education departments.\n\nTeaching teenagers to be better citizens would be better left to parents and other family members, and local schools. Even community organizations such as the Scouts and Rotarians would do a better job than government agencies.\n\nA Government That Corrects Itself\n\nInstead, history and government courses are too often taught in public schools as a series of human rights abuses. Typically classes teach about the U.S. crimes against Native Americans, Mexicans, African-Americans, Irish and Italian immigrants, and women. Most recently, we've been hearing about the treatment of lesbian, gay and transgender communities.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not suggesting schools should teach a censored form of patriotism that presents an America free of all its warts.\n\nBy all means we should recognize our flaws at home and mistakes abroad. But we should also recognize that our founders were wise and exceptionally well-educated.\n\nThey created a system of government that corrects itself. Although it is often done late, our country has continued to correct past mistakes over its 239-year history. It leads to a more perfect union.\n\nUnfortunately, imposing more American history and civics classes on today\u2019s restless students likely will only make things worse. If they're developed by Washington then they'll be even worse.\n\nA glaring example is the community service requirement now imposed on students in about 83 percent of the nation\u2019s public school districts.\n\nThe requirement violates our Constitution\u2019s declaration of individual freedom. It forces students to spend numerous hours each month away from the classroom. They have to do public service projects like recycling, clean up trash in poor neighborhoods and even attend re-education sessions to ensure they are marching in step with the views of Democrats.\n\n\"A Set Of Disconnected Facts\"\n\nNow there\u2019s even a push to require all high school seniors to pass the same citizenship test required of immigrants to America. This despite the fact that more than 90 percent of recent high school students have spent a semester studying civics and a majority have spent a year studying American history.\n\nAs Peter Levine of Boston\u2019s Tufts University points out: \u201cRequiring students to pass a citizenship exam will reduce both the amount and quality of civic education in our schools.\u201d\n\nThe problem with civics is not that we fail to teach it, he says. \u201cThe problem is that civics is often viewed as a set of disconnected facts, not as a challenging and inspiring subject that will continue to interest us after high school.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right, of course. And that\u2019s exactly why school programs for American history should be made in towns and cities, not our national government.\n\nIn the Baltimore area, where I live, local history becomes even more fascinating when linked to the nation's history.\n\nConsider just a few local events: the voyages of discovery and mapping of Chesapeake Bay by Captain John Smith; the founding of the Baltimore railroad that allowed early pioneers to head west; the bombardment of Fort McHenry during the War of 1812 that inspired Francis Scott Key to write the National Anthem; and Baltimore\u2019s key role in the Civil War.

Photo: AP/Brennan Linsley\nPRO: Teaching the ideas of American freedom and equality\nAmerican high school graduates don\u2019t understand the ideas of freedom and equality, and where in our history they came from. These principles are essential to our government and our democracy. If kids don't learn them now, how will they believe in them as adults and defend them?\n\nMany people are quick to blame teachers for the problems with America\u2019s schools.\n\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress has shown that many students are not even mastering the basics of U.S. history and government.\n\nFor example, the most recent NAEP U.S. history exam was in 2010. It found just 12 percent of all U.S. high school seniors score at or above the \u201cproficient\u201d level. Being \u201cproficient\u201d means having a solid understanding of a subject. In other words, only 12 in 100 students understood the test and did well.\n\nIn civics \u2014 the subject of U.S. government \u2014 the test scores were somewhat better. Still, slightly less than one-fourth of all high school seniors performed at or above the \u201cproficient\u201d level. Most of them did not understand the questions that were on the test or did not do well.\n\nChange How We Teach Teachers\n\nWe often hear about the need to improve education in the STEM subjects. These are science, technology, engineering and math. But American students perform worse on American history tests than in any other subject.\n\nIt\u2019s unfair to blame America\u2019s 125,000 social studies teachers, however. I\u2019ve been with the Ashbrook Center at Ashland University in Ashbrook, Ohio, for 17 years. In that time, about 8,000 teachers from across the country have participated in our educational programs. I\u2019ve met many teachers. I know from first-hand experience they\u2019re not the problem.\n\nThe problem is the way teachers are trained. Teachers spend too much time learning how to teach and not enough time learning what to teach.\n\nWithout a major change in how teachers are taught, America will continue down the same path. We'll continue to raise generation after generation of students who do not understand what it means to be an American. These kids will think freedom of speech means the right to take \u201cselfies.\u201d They'll believe freedom of religion means removing religion from public life. Our Founding Fathers are already commonly referred to as dead old white men. Someday people may think they're completely unimportant.\n\nThey also may end up thinking Washington and Lincoln as having something to do with Presidents Day, a holiday for shopping. They might just think the Fourth of July is a day for fireworks and a cookout.\n\nMore Than Dates And Names\n\nTeaching government and history involves more than just significant names, dates and events. It involves more than just knowing a little about a handful of historically significant documents. Teachers need a deep understanding of the Declaration of Independence, which helped the United States separate from Britain. They need to know the Bill of Rights, which covers the rights of all Americans and makes up part of the Constitution, and the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves.\n\nTo successfully teach U.S. history and government our teachers need to rely less on textbooks. Instead, they should rely more on the writings and thinking of those who shaped our country.\n\nConsider civil rights. The changes in America\u2019s mind, heart and laws over time on the subject of racial equality didn\u2019t happen by accident. That\u2019s why we urge teachers to closely study the writings of the people who shaped America\u2019s thinking.\n\nThis would include, for example, Frederick Douglass\u2019 1852 speech, \u201cWhat to the Slave is the Fourth of July?\u201d It would also include Lincoln\u2019s famous Emancipation Proclamation, Gettysburg Address, and \u201cResolution Submitting the Thirteenth Amendment (outlawing slavery) to the States.\u201d It would include the texts of the U.S. Supreme Court's key decisions that ended the separation of blacks and whites, known as desegregation. Martin Luther King\u2019s 1963 \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech would of course also be present.\n\nTeachers who understand the importance of such documents and use them in the classroom will be better teachers. Their students will learn more. And they\u2019ll be better prepared for the responsibilities of citizenship as adults.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Roger L.

Poison control workers say that as the e-cigarette industry has boomed, the number of children exposed to the liquid nicotine that gives hand-held vaporizing gadgets their kick also is rising. Photo: AP Photo/Rick Bowmer\nPRO: A dangerous product is being advertised as healthy\nIn 2014, the Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s word of the year was \u201cvape.\u201d Simply, it's breathing in water vapor through an electronic cigarette, or e-cigarette.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should take a hint from the dictionary. It should write its own definition of e-cigarettes. They contain nicotine, so it should define them as a tobacco product.\n\nCongress created the FDA in 1906. The government was concerned then over the safety of America\u2019s food and medicine. At the time, food and drugs were filled with toxic dyes and preservatives. People were selling fake miracle cures known as \"snake oil.\"\n\nThe agency was created to help people know if a product is safe and healthy.\n\nThe FDA was made to regulate products just like e-cigarettes.\n\nCotton Candy Flavor\n\nE-cigarettes claim to be healthy. But there's no proof. Right now more than 16 million children can legally buy e-cigs. They can give themselves as much nicotine as they want. Nicotine is not harmless. Accidentally drinking liquid nicotine has caused a huge jump in poisonings. Two months ago, a toddler in New York state died from swallowing liquid nicotine.\n\nAnd e-cigs are booming. Sales of e-cigarettes are expected to go up by four times by 2017.\n\nThe growth is partly because of advertising. The other reason is the increase in the number of high school students using them. The many types of e-cig flavors attract young people. Cotton candy, gummy bear and root beer are just some of them.\n\nE-cigs should be regulated, not banned. The FDA is the only agency that can do that. The FDA should stop sales and advertising to kids. It should also make sure that health claims made by e-cig companies are true. Finally, it should make companies list what's in e-cig juice.\n\nSounds Harmless, But Isn't\n\n\u201cJuice\u201d sounds harmless, but it's not. It is actually liquid nicotine. The liquid nicotine is heated inside the e-cig and turned into vapor. Then users breathe the vapor in and out. At least it's better than breathing burning tobacco. Burning tobacco releases thousands of chemicals, so e-cigs are safer than cigarettes.\n\nStill, cigarettes kill 6 million people a year. They might be the deadliest invention in human history.\n\nE-cigarettes could help. They could save millions of lives, but only if smokers switched from puffing to vaping, and then quit vaping.\n\nThe problem is that no one knows if e-cigarettes are healthy. Some people online claim e-cigs have helped them quit smoking. Yet it might just be a few people.\n\nA new government study found something to worry about. It found that smokers often use both e-cigarettes and regular cigarettes. This shows that e-cigarettes don't help people quit smoking, and may actually make it harder for smokers to quit.\n\nNicotine Is A Poison\n\nStill, e-cigarettes are often advertised as being healthy. Researchers at the University of California-San Francisco found that more than 9 out of 10 e-cig websites either claimed that they had health benefits, or hinted there were some. Two-thirds of websites claimed that they help users quit smoking.\n\nThis is false advertising. Nicotine is addictive and it is a poison. The FDA should make both of these facts clear by requiring warning labels on e-cigarettes and bottles of e-juices. Skin contact with even small amounts of liquid nicotine can cause dizziness, vomiting and seizures. Swallowing it can be deadly.\n\nRight now, a dangerous product is being advertised and sold as a healthy one. This is exactly what the FDA exists to prevent.\n\nE-cigarettes are not necessarily poison. But gummy bear, cotton candy and sour apple shouldn\u2019t make them easier for kids to use.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Sarah Milov is an assistant professor of history at the University of Virginia.

Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of Tribune or Newsela.\nCON: Don't treat e-cigarettes like tobacco cigarettes\nIn 1964, the government released its very first report on tobacco smoking.\n\nIt looked at scientific evidence from more than 7,000 articles on smoking and disease. Based on those studies, the report decided that tobacco smoking is a major cause of lung and throat cancer.\n\nThe report launched a \u201cwar on smoking.\u201d It soon led to health warnings on cigarette packages. Cigarette ads were no longer allowed on radio and television. In recent years, smoking has been banned in some public places, like restaurants.\n\nOver these 50 years of cigarette laws, two facts have been repeated over and over: 1) smoking tobacco kills people; 2) once a person is addicted to smoking cigarettes, or, really, the nicotine in cigarettes, it is very hard for a person to quit.\n\nA Way To Stop Smoking\n\nThen an invention came along \u2014 e-cigarettes. They supply nicotine in much the same way as a tobacco cigarette. Yet, they don't appear to cause cancer or lung disease. Many people cheered the new invention.\n\nFinally there was a product that could help those who were addicted. People who had tried other ways of quitting now had another shot.\n\nLives could be saved. People could replace their tobacco cigarettes with e-cigarettes. Cigarette smokers inhale smoke and its carcinogens, like tar. Switch to e-cigarettes, and they'd just breathe water vapor. And that horrible smell would be replaced with just the light scent of a flavor like mint or strawberry.\n\nLives could be saved.\n\nOne would expect health professionals to be cheering loudly. But some people appear to be addicted to regulation and laws. Some even want to ban e-cigs.\n\nA Ban Would Not Help\n\nHow do they go about banning a product that saves lives?\n\nMany of these regulators are worried about \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d \u201cWhat if\u201d vaping turns out to be harmful? \u201cWhat if\u201d people who vape start smoking?\n\nThese \u201cwhat ifs\u201d are quite unlikely. However, they are the reasons people give for supporting bans. Some want bans on the sale of e-cigarettes. Others want to add grossly high taxes on them. Some even want total bans on the use of e-cigarettes in public.\n\nBut such policies mean nicotine addicts will be less likely to use e-cigarettes. Instead, they may be more likely to keep smoking tobacco. The obvious result will be more tobacco smoking and thus, more illness and death.\n\nMitch Zeller is the director of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products. He made the key point clear: \u201cPeople are smoking for the nicotine, but dying from the tar.\u201d\n\nHe says e-cigarette regulation should take into account that different nicotine products \"pose different levels of risk to the individual.\u201d He believes they should be regulated according to their risks.\n\nSmoking Is More Dangerous\n\nWhich means America should not treat e-cigarettes just like cigarettes. Smoking cigarettes is clearly far more dangerous than vaping.\n\nIn fact, vaping can help people to stop smoking. Because of that, we need carefully written rules. If it steers Americans from smoking toward vaping as a replacement, it will provide \u201can extraordinary public health opportunity,\u201d in Zeller's words.\n\nZeller makes a lot of sense. Then there are the regulation nuts. They want laws to treat e-cigarettes the same as the far, far more dangerous tobacco cigarettes. These people are the enemy of public health.\n\nSmoking kills. Vaping is a safer alternative. Our nation\u2019s laws will save lives if they reflect this fact.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Amy Ridenour is chairman of the National Center for Public Policy Research in Washington, DC.

Poison control workers say that as the e-cigarette industry has boomed, the number of children exposed to the liquid nicotine that gives hand-held vaporizing gadgets their kick also is rising. Photo: AP Photo/Rick Bowmer\nPRO: FDA should do its job; 16 million U.S. kids are inhaling dangerous substances\nIn 2014, the Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s (OED) word of the year was \u201cvape.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should take a hint from the OED and write its own definition of e-cigarettes \u2014 a definition that will treat them as a tobacco product.\n\nCongress created the FDA in 1906 amid concern over the quality and purity of America\u2019s food and drug supply, which was awash in toxic dyes and preservatives, and shaped by the outrageous claims of the era\u2019s \u201cpatent medicines.\u201d\n\nThe agency\u2019s creation reflected a belief that consumers could not, on their own, always make determinations about product safety, reliability, and health.\n\nIn short, the FDA was made to regulate products just like e-cigarettes.\n\nE-cigarettes have created a market that abounds in unproven health claims; a market in which more than 16 million children can legally buy e-cigs and administer unspecified amounts of nicotine to themselves; a market in which the accidental ingestion of liquid nicotine has caused a huge uptick in the number of cases reported to local poison control centers \u2014 including the death of a toddler in upstate New York two months ago.\n\nAnd it is a market that is booming. Last year, analysts at Wells Fargo estimated the overall value of the e-cigarette market at $2.5 billion and predicted growth to $10 billion annually by 2017.\n\nMarket growth can be attributed in part to aggressive marketing, and in part to high adoption rates among high school students attracted to the variety of e-cig flavors, including cotton candy, gummy bear and root beer float.\n\nThe FDA is the only agency that can regulate \u2014 not ban \u2014 this nicotine-fueled juggernaut. The FDA should prohibit sales and marketing to kids, make sure that health claims made by e-cig companies are true, and require companies to add ingredient lists to e-cig juice.\n\nThis \u201cjuice\u201d \u2014 a misleadingly benign euphemism for a flavored nicotine solution \u2014 is heated through a battery-powered cylinder, which can look like a cigarette, a pen or a kazoo.\n\nThe devices vaporize a flavored nicotine solution that users then inhale and exhale. Users inhale this flavored vapor and not combusted tobacco, which means e-cigs are safer relative to cigarettes.\n\nBut, then again, cigarettes are, in the words of historian Robert Proctor, the deadliest invention in human history, killing 6 million people per year.\n\nAnd herein lies the potential virtue of the e-cigarette: it could be a powerful tool for saving millions of lives if smokers switched from puffing to vaping to, ideally, nothing. As a cessation tool, e-cigarettes could have the same relationship to cigarettes as methadone does to heroin.\n\nThe problem is that the safety and health claims of e-cigarettes have not been proven. Particularly in the online vaping community, anecdotes abound testifying to the e-cig\u2019s utility in helping folks kick the habit. But in the words of Mitch Zeller, head of the FDA\u2019s Tobacco Products Division, \u201cFDA can\u2019t make regulatory policy on the basis of anecdotal evidence.\u201d\n\nPreliminary evidence from a major longitudinal cohort study should give regulators pause. Initial findings from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health indicate high levels of \u201cdual use\u201d of tobacco products, meaning that smokers frequently use both e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes.\n\nThese findings are consistent with other studies that have found that contrary to being cessation aids, e-cigarettes may actually make it harder for smokers to quit.\n\nNevertheless, e-cigarettes are frequently advertised as proven tools of public health. Researchers at the University of California-San Francisco found that 95 percent of e-cig websites made \u201cexplicit or implicit health-related claims,\u201d and 64 percent made claims directly-related to smoking cessation.\n\nThis is false advertising. Nicotine is addictive and it is a poison \u2014 two facts that the FDA should make explicit by requiring warning labels on e-cigarette devices and vials of e-juices. Dermal contact with even small quantities of liquid nicotine can cause dizziness, vomiting and seizures. Ingestion can be deadly.\n\nA world in which a dangerous product is marketed and sold as a healthy one is exactly what the FDA exists to prevent.\n\nE-cigarettes are not snake oil. But gummy bear, cotton candy and sour apple shouldn\u2019t make them go down any easier.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Sarah Milov is an assistant professor of history at the University of Virginia.

People could replace their tobacco cigarettes with e-cigarettes; switch out smoke and carcinogens with water vapor and the horrible smell with no smell at all \u2014 or the light scent of a chosen flavor, such as mint or strawberry.\n\nLives could be saved.\n\nOne would expect the response of the public health community to be a near-universal \u201churrah\u201d \u2014 and in some quarters, it has been.\n\nBut for those who appear to be addicted to regulation, and not to public health, e-cigarettes provide an unwelcome challenge.\n\nHow do they go about banning access to a product that saves lives? And what do they say when people, quite reasonably, ask, \u201cWhy do you want to?\u201d\n\nFor many of these regulators, the answer is as \u201cwhat if.\u201d \u201cWhat if\u201d vaping \u2014 inhaling water vapor through an e-cigarette \u2014 turns out to be harmful? \u201cWhat if\u201d people who vape decide to start smoking, because they first vaped?\n\nIt is on the basis of these \u201cwhat ifs\u201d \u2014 however unlikely \u2014 that some support bans on the sale of e-cigarettes, or grossly high taxes on e-cigarettes, or outright bans on the use of e-cigarettes in public.\n\nBut such policies mean nicotine addicts will be less likely to use e-cigarettes, and relatively more likely to keep smoking tobacco. The obvious and predictable result is relatively more tobacco smoking and thus, more illness and death.\n\nThe director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, Mitch Zeller, made the key point clear in an interview with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\u2019s New Public Health: \u201cPeople are smoking for the nicotine, but dying from the tar.\u201d\n\nHe says e-cigarette regulation should take into account the \u201ccontinuum of risk: that there are different nicotine-containing and nicotine-delivering products that pose different levels of risk to the individual,\u201d and regulate accordingly.\n\nWhich means America should not treat e-cigarettes and vaping just like tobacco smoking and smoking, because smoking is far more dangerous than vaping.\n\nIn fact, because vaping can cause people to voluntarily stop smoking, a carefully crafted regulatory policy that steers Americans from smoking toward vaping as a replacement provides \u201can extraordinary public health opportunity.\u201d\n\nZeller makes a lot of sense. By contrast, regulation zealots, such as those in Michigan who in January lobbied against a state-level bill banning the sale of e-cigarettes to minors because it did not treat e-cigarettes the same as the far, far more dangerous tobacco cigarettes, are an enemy of public health.\n\nSmoking kills. Vaping is a safer alternative, and our nation\u2019s regulatory policy will save lives if it reflects this fact.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Amy Ridenour is chairman of the National Center for Public Policy Research in Washington, DC.

Poison control workers say that as the e-cigarette industry has boomed, the number of children exposed to the liquid nicotine that gives hand-held vaporizing gadgets their kick also is rising. Photo: AP Photo/Rick Bowmer\nPRO: E-cigs shouldn't be banned, but they must be regulated\nIn 2014, the Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s word of the year was \u201cvape.\u201d Simply put, it's breathing water vapor in and out through an electronic cigarette, or e-cigarette.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should take a hint from the dictionary. It should write its own definition of e-cigarettes. They contain liquid nicotine, so the FDA should define them as a tobacco product.\n\nCongress created the FDA in 1906. The government was concerned then over the quality and safety of America\u2019s food and drug supply. At the time, food and drugs were awash in toxic dyes and preservatives. The agency was also shaped by the outrageous claims of fake miracle cures known as \"snake oil.\"\n\nThe agency was created to help people know whether a product is safe and healthy.\n\nIn short, the FDA was made to watch over products just like e-cigarettes.\n\nNicotine Is Not Harmless\n\nE-cigarettes claim to be healthy, but there is no proof. Right now more than 16 million children can legally buy e-cigs and give themselves as much nicotine as they want. Nicotine is not harmless. Accidentally drinking liquid nicotine has caused a huge increase in poisonings \u2014 including the death of a toddler in New York state two months ago.\n\nSales of e-cigs are booming. Last year, analysts at Wells Fargo bank estimated that sales of e-cigarette and other products amount to $2.5 billion a year. They predict it will rise to $10 billion annually by 2017.\n\nThe growth of e-cigs is partly due to advertising. Yet, the other reason is the growth in the number of high school students using them. The variety of e-cig flavors attract young people. Cotton candy, gummy bear and root beer float are just some of them.\n\nE-cigs should be regulated, not banned. The FDA is the only agency that can do that. The FDA should prevent sales and advertising to kids. It should also make sure that health claims made by e-cig companies are true. Finally, it should require companies to list what's in e-cig juice.\n\n\u201cJuice\u201d sounds harmless, but it's far from it. It is, in fact, flavored nicotine liquid. The liquid nicotine is heated through the e-cig and turned into vapor that users then inhale and exhale. At least, people inhale this flavored vapor and not burning tobacco. Because burning tobacco releases thousands of chemicals, e-cigs are safer than cigarettes.\n\nStop And Think\n\nBut, then again, cigarettes kill 6 million people per year. One historian called them the deadliest invention in human history.\n\nAnd here is the possible value of the e-cigarette: it could be a powerful tool for saving millions of lives if smokers switched from puffing to vaping, and then to nothing.\n\nThe problem is that the safety and health claims of e-cigarettes have not been proven. Online, some folks claim e-cigs have helped them kick the habit, yet it might just be a few people.\n\nInitial evidence from a major new study should make people stop and think. Early findings from the study of 46,000 Americans by the National Institutes of Health and the FDA indicate that smokers frequently use both e-cigarettes and regular cigarettes.\n\nThese findings agree with other studies that found that rather than helping people quit smoking, e-cigarettes may actually make it harder for smokers to quit.\n\nBeware Of Advertising\n\nNevertheless, e-cigarettes are frequently advertised as if they've been proven to be healthy. Researchers at the University of California-San Francisco found that 95 percent of e-cig websites either made outright claims that they had health benefits, or hinted there were some. Sixty-four percent made claims directly related to helping users quit smoking.\n\nThis is false advertising. Nicotine is addictive and it is a poison. The FDA should make both of these facts clear by requiring warning labels on e-cigarettes and bottles of e-juices. Skin contact with even small quantities of liquid nicotine can cause dizziness, vomiting and seizures. Swallowing it can be deadly.\n\nA world in which a dangerous product is marketed and sold as a healthy one is exactly what the FDA exists to prevent.\n\nE-cigarettes are not snake oil. But gummy bear, cotton candy and sour apple shouldn\u2019t make them any easier to use.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Sarah Milov is an assistant professor of history at the University of Virginia.

Based on those studies, the report cited tobacco smoking as a major cause of lung and throat cancer.\n\nThe report launched a \u201cwar on smoking.\u201d It soon led to health warnings on cigarette packages and bans on cigarette commercials on radio and television. In recent years, it has led to bans on smoking in public places, like restaurants.\n\nOver this half-century of cigarette regulation, two facts have been impressed upon the nation: 1) smoking tobacco kills people; 2) once a person is addicted to smoking cigarettes, or, rather, to the nicotine one ingests by smoking cigarettes, it is very hard for a person to quit.\n\nAn Anti-Smoking Aid\n\nThen an invention came along \u2014 e-cigarettes. They supply nicotine in much the same way as a tobacco cigarette. Yet, they don't appear to cause cancer or lung disease. Many people cheered the new invention.\n\nFinally there was a product that could help those who were addicted. People who had tried other ways of quitting now had another anti-smoking aid to try.\n\nLives could be saved. People could replace their tobacco cigarettes with e-cigarettes. Instead of inhaling smoke and all its carcinogens \u2014 like tar \u2014 they'd just breathe water vapor. And that horrible smell would be replaced with just the light scent of a flavor like mint or strawberry.\n\nLives could be saved.\n\nOne would expect the public health community to be cheering loudly \u2014 and some some health professionals have, in fact, been supportive of e-cigarettes.\n\nBut some people appear to be addicted to regulation, and not to public health. For them, e-cigarettes challenge their beliefs.\n\nToo Many Worries?\n\nHow can they try to ban a product that saves lives?\n\nMany of these regulators are worried about the \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d \u201cWhat if\u201d vaping turns out to be harmful? \u201cWhat if\u201d people who vape decide to start smoking?\n\nThese \u201cwhat ifs\u201d are quite unlikely. However, it is on the basis of them that some people support bans. Some want bans on the sale of e-cigarettes. Others want to add grossly high taxes on e-cigarettes to discourage people from using them. Some even want outright bans on the use of e-cigarettes in public.\n\nBut such policies mean nicotine addicts will be less likely to use e-cigarettes. Instead, they may be more likely to keep smoking tobacco, which would obviously lead to more tobacco smoking and thus, more illness and death.\n\n\"Different Levels Of Risk\"\n\nThe director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, Mitch Zeller, made the key point clear: \u201cPeople are smoking for the nicotine, but dying from the tar.\u201d\n\nHe says e-cigarette regulation should take into account that different nicotine products \"pose different levels of risk to the individual.\u201d He believes they should be regulated according to their risks.\n\nWhich means America should not treat e-cigarettes and vaping just like tobacco smoking and smoke. Smoking is clearly far more dangerous than vaping.\n\nIn fact, vaping can cause people to voluntarily stop smoking. Because of that, we need carefully crafted rules. If they are well-written to steer Americans from smoking toward vaping as a replacement, it will provide \u201can extraordinary public health opportunity,\u201d in Zeller's words.\n\nZeller makes a lot of sense. On the other side are the regulation nuts. These people are the enemy of public health.\n\nSmoking kills. Vaping is a safer alternative.

Last year, analysts at Wells Fargo bank estimated the overall value of the e-cigarette market at $2.5 billion and predicted that it will grow to $10 billion annually by 2017.\n\nThe product's growth can be attributed in part to aggressive marketing. Yet, the other part of that growth is the high adoption rates among high school students attracted to the variety of e-cig flavors, including cotton candy, gummy bear and root beer float.\n\nThis nicotine-fueled movement should be regulated, not banned. The FDA is the only agency that can do that. The FDA should prohibit sales and marketing to kids and make sure that health claims made by e-cig companies are true. It should also require companies to add ingredient lists to e-cig juice.\n\nFlavored Nicotine Solution\n\n\u201cJuice\u201d is a misleadingly harmless euphemism for a flavored nicotine solution. The liquid nicotine is heated through a battery-powered cylinder, which can look like a cigarette, a pen or a kazoo.\n\nThe devices vaporize a flavored nicotine solution that users then inhale and exhale. Users inhale this flavored vapor and not burning tobacco, which means e-cigs are safer compared to cigarettes.\n\nBut, then again, cigarettes kill 6 million people per year. In the words of historian Robert Proctor, they are the deadliest invention in human history.\n\nAnd herein lies the potential virtue of the e-cigarette: it could be a powerful tool for saving millions of lives if smokers switched from puffing to vaping to, ideally, nothing.\n\nThe problem is that the safety and health claims of e-cigarettes have not been proven.

But in the words of Mitch Zeller, head of the FDA\u2019s Tobacco Products Division, \u201cFDA can\u2019t make regulatory policy on the basis of anecdotal evidence.\u201d\n\nInitial evidence from a major new study should give regulators pause.

For them, e-cigarettes provide an unwelcome challenge.\n\nHow can they want to ban the use of a product that saves lives?\n\nFor many of these regulators, they are worried about \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d \u201cWhat if\u201d vaping turns out to be harmful? \u201cWhat if\u201d people who vape decide to start smoking?\n\nThese \u201cwhat ifs\u201d are quite unlikely. However, it is on the basis of them that some people support bans. Some want bans on the sale of e-cigarettes, or grossly high taxes on e-cigarettes to discourage the use of e-cigs. Some even want outright bans on the use of e-cigarettes in public.\n\nBut such policies mean nicotine addicts will be less likely to use e-cigarettes. Instead, they may be more likely to keep smoking tobacco. The obvious and predictable result is relatively more tobacco smoking and thus, more illness and death.\n\nDon't Treat E-Cigs Like Cigarettes\n\nThe director of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, Mitch Zeller, made the key point clear: \u201cPeople are smoking for the nicotine, but dying from the tar.\u201d\n\nHe says e-cigarette regulation should take into account that different nicotine products \"pose different levels of risk to the individual,\u201d and regulate accordingly.\n\nWhich means America should not treat e-cigarettes and vaping just like tobacco smoking and smoking. Smoking is clearly far more dangerous than vaping.\n\nIn fact, vaping can cause people to voluntarily stop smoking. Because of that, a carefully crafted regulatory policy that steers Americans from smoking toward vaping as a replacement provides \u201can extraordinary public health opportunity.\u201d\n\nZeller makes a lot of sense. By contrast, there are the regulation fanatics. These people are the enemy of public health.\n\nSmoking kills. Vaping is a safer alternative, and our nation\u2019s regulatory policy will save lives if it reflects this fact.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Amy Ridenour is chairman of the National Center for Public Policy Research in Washington, DC.

The problem is that too many employers are unable to find qualified candidates for jobs they have open.\n\nShortcomings in our education system and how we train workers are to blame.

This problem is known as the skills gap.\n\nFor many years it has been seen as an education issue and left to politicians, educators and administrators to fix. But companies are the ones that hire people spat out by our education system and they can\u2019t afford to wait for others to find a solution.\n\nAnd many businesses haven\u2019t. The nature of enterprise is solving problems and fulfilling needs, so it should surprise no one that business leaders are innovating their way out of the problem.\n\nTalent Pipeline Management\n\nA number of companies and partners have pioneered a whole new approach to finding workers by applying the lessons of supply chains. It's simply the common-sense practice of planning ahead and establishing processes and relationships with trusted suppliers. It ensures that you have what you need, when you need it. When applied to workers we call it talent pipeline management.\n\nTalent pipeline management isn\u2019t much different from the supply chains that companies use to source goods and parts, money or information. It involves relationships based on need and demand. In this case, the suppliers are schools that provide the companies with the skilled workers they need \u2014 and the schools get what they need in help and support from businesses looking to hire their students.\n\nRolls-Royce employed this strategy when it built its massive Crosspointe engine manufacturing complex in Virginia.\n\nIt was a $170 million investment in the first-ever Rolls-Royce facility to be built from the ground up on U.S. soil.

The employer wins by having steady access to candidates whose skills fit the demands of the position. The school benefits by being able to show that it finds job opportunities for its graduates.

It is called a \"skills gap.\"\n\nFor years it's been seen as an education problem, so it's been left to our political leaders in Washington and educators to fix. Yet companies need to hire workers now.\n\nColleges And Companies As Partners\n\nOur business leaders are now trying to solve the problem their own way.\n\nA number of companies and universities are taking a new approach. They're applying the lessons of supply chains. Businesses work with suppliers they trust. It makes sure that they have what they need, when they need it. Companies use supply chains to get parts, money or information.\n\nNow they're using that idea to find workers. It is called \"talent pipeline management.\" It isn\u2019t much different from a supply chain. It is about partners working together when each has a need. In business it is called demand.

In this case, the suppliers are schools and the companies need the students.\n\nRolls-Royce tried this when it built its huge $170 million auto factory in Virginia. Before spending all that money, the company wanted to be sure that it could get a supply of skilled workers.\n\nSo it partnered with community colleges in Virginia.

The company wins by getting a supply of workers who have the skills to do their jobs. The school wins by being able to say it found jobs for its students. In turn, that makes new students want to go to that school.

That way students can easily find good jobs at companies.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem. The purpose of education is to develop a wide range of skills. Students need more skills than just those for one job, at one company.\n\nThat\u2019s why the plan by business groups is wrong. They just want a supply of skilled workers going straight to them from universities.\n\nTake A Look At Germany\n\nOf course it\u2019s true that students who finish college earn more money than those who don't. However, the problem is that far too many start college and then drop out. Then they owe money that they borrowed for school. Without jobs, they have a hard time paying it off.\n\nNo wonder. Many high schoolers don't really want to go to college. They just want to start working.\n\nSchools should not just make new, easier courses for students who aren\u2019t meant for college. Instead, the answer is more vocational training, which teaches skills for a certain trade such as auto repair, farming, plumbing or even working in tourism jobs or running shops.\n\nIn Germany, students who would do well in college are separated from those who may do better in vocational training. It happens right before high school.\n\nMore than two-thirds of German workers received vocational training from technical schools, groups that teach trades, and training programs at companies.

Jobs are available, but many employers cannot find workers with the right skills to fill them. It's a cruel situation.\n\nOur education system and worker training are to blame. If nothing is fixed, the supply of skilled workers will decrease even more \u2014 leaving some 5 million jobs empty by 2018. We won't have enough skilled workers to keep pace with the needs of employers. The problem is called a \"skills gap.\"\n\nFor many years it has been seen as an education issue, so it was left to our political leaders in Washington and educators to fix. But companies are the ones that hire people graduating from colleges. They can\u2019t afford to wait for others to find a solution, so they haven't.\n\nA New Approach\n\nA number of companies and universities have pioneered a whole new approach to finding workers. They're applying the lessons of supply chains. It's simple common sense. Businesses plan ahead and build relationships with trusted suppliers. It makes sure that they have what they need, when they need it. When it's applied to workers we call it \"talent pipeline management.\"\n\nTalent pipeline management isn\u2019t much different from the idea behind supply chains. Companies use these ideas to get their parts, money or information. It involves relationships based on demand between customers and users. In this case, the suppliers are schools and the users are the companies that hire the students.\n\nRolls-Royce used this idea when it built its huge auto factory in Virginia.\n\nIt spent $170 million on the first-ever Rolls-Royce factory to be built from the ground up on U.S. soil. Before spending all that money, the company wanted to be sure that it would have a supply of skilled workers.\n\nSo it partnered with the local community college. Together, they established a program to teach students the manufacturing process. Since starting this partnership, Rolls-Royce has helped design course work and trained students on the machines used at the factory.\n\nCreating Opportunities\n\nThese kinds of arrangements aid everyone involved. The employer wins by having a steady supply of workers with skills to match the jobs. The school benefits by being able to say it found job opportunities for its graduates. In turn, that makes new students want to go to the school. Then those new students receive an education that comes with real chances at finding a job.\n\nThrough talent pipeline management, we can achieve education and train workers based on need, or demand. It will help create opportunities for individuals and make sure there are skilled workers ready to help businesses thrive and grow.\n\nABOUT THE WRITERS: John R.

That way graduates can easily find well-paying jobs in today\u2019s businesses.\n\nThere\u2019s just one major hitch: The primary purpose of education is to develop citizens with a wide variety of skills. Many skills are needed to live a full life in our modern world. The goal is not to create graduates who are able to do just one job, at one company.\n\nThat\u2019s why the recent plan launched by business groups is a poor one. They simply want to create a pipeline of skilled workers from universities straight to them.\n\nOf course it\u2019s true that college graduates earn more money over their lifetimes than those without a degree. However, the problem is that far too many who start college drop out. Then they end up with large amounts of student loan debt with not much chance of paying it off. Many are forced into bankruptcy.\n\nLook At Technical Schools\n\nThe Pell Grant is the government's largest aid program to help students with little money pay for a college degree. The government says in the 2011-2012 school year, a majority of Pell students dropped out before completing their sophomore year.\n\nNo wonder. It\u2019s clear that many high school graduates don't really want to go to college. They'd rather just start careers.\n\nThe solution is not to have schools create new and easier courses for students who aren\u2019t meant for college. Instead, it should be to create more vocational training, so they can learn a specific trade such as auto repair, farming, plumbing or even working in tourism jobs or running shops. We should look to Germany as an example.\n\nIn Germany, the educational system separates students by those suited for higher education and those who may do better in vocational training. It happens at an early age, often in the eighth or ninth grade.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the German workforce has received vocational training from technical schools, groups that teach trades and company training programs. In 2012 alone, German companies hired and trained about 600,000 workers.\n\nBoost Vocational Education\n\nThe system obviously is working. In October, even with business being slow, Germany\u2019s youth unemployment was 7.7 percent compared to the 12.7 percent of young people in the United States who couldn't find jobs.\n\nIn Germany, vocational students learn both in the classroom and on the job. Typically they attend vocational schools two days a week and then spend three days a week as an apprentice in a profession they choose. Slightly more than 50 percent of German students are in vocational training.\n\nGerman companies have even brought these programs to factories they own in the U.S.\n\nVolkswagen\u2019s huge auto factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, is a good example. The company runs its Volkswagen Academy right in the same building as its factory. Students who complete a three-year program earn a starting salary of $22 an hour. After, they can work at German auto factories anywhere in the world.\n\nIt\u2019s time to make vocational education happen more in the U.S. We should adapt the German approach here. Most Americans don\u2019t need a university degree, but all need a well-paying career.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Whitt Flora, an independent journalist, is a former chief congressional correspondent for Aviation & Science Technology Magazine and a former White House correspondent for the Columbus Dispatch.

It details the CIA\u2019s \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d methods in the frightening days, weeks and months after that fateful day.\n\nWith its provocative detail splashed across the TV screens, front pages and websites of our media, the report will undoubtedly endanger American lives. It gives extremists one more rallying cry to attack U.S. interests and strengthen their recruiting efforts. It also forces other governments and intelligence services to show that they\u2019re keeping their distance from Uncle Sam.\n\nUnsavory Methods Were Known\n\nTo be clear, the report was revealing only in its raw detail of CIA activities against particular detainees. We\u2019ve known for many years that the CIA used unsavory methods.\n\nIn fact, news surfaced years ago that the CIA deprived suspects of sleep, chained them to walls, threatened them with gruesome death and so on. At the time, government officials, opinion leaders and the broad public began a serious national debate over whether the United States should ever torture.\n\nWith a few exceptions, we even reached a general agreement that we should avoid anything that smacks of torture and consider employing it only in the most extreme cases. An obvious situation is when the United States faces the immediate threat of an attack that could kill hundreds, if not thousands, of people.\n\nThat\u2019s all fine years after the fact. Yet, as the Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Diane Feinstein acknowledged in the report, the days after Sept. 11 were ones of overwhelming fear that much greater attacks were coming.\n\nIn fact, Feinstein noted that, after Sept. 11, the CIA \u201cwas encouraged by political leaders and the public to do whatever it could to prevent another attack.\u201d She went on to say that the \u201cIntelligence Committee as well often pushes intelligence agencies to act quickly in response to threats and world events.\u201d\n\nThat, by the way, is no different than how our nation\u2019s leaders have behaved at other perilous times. During the Civil War, for instance, President Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus, which prevents Americans from being unlawfully imprisoned. What later seems horrifying often seems vital at the time.\n\nAllies May Hesitate Helping U.S.\n\nFeinstein says that she hopes the report will serve as a warning for the future. She hopes it will ensure that, even when facing national security perils, the United States never again abandons its values.\n\nNow, the extremists of al-Qaida, Islamic State and other dangerous groups who plot every day to attack America will have one more rallying cry and recruiting tool. That means more extremists with more motivation to plot and launch more attacks against more Americans.\n\nNow, governments and intelligence agencies with which Washington has worked regularly, whether in Europe, the Middle East, or elsewhere, will hesitate before working too closely with the United States.\n\nThat means less intelligence information from around the world will flow to Washington.

The methods used to wage the \u201cwar on terror\u201d are of great interest to the public.\n\nDespite gruesome details included in the report about what was done to detainees, the release is not likely to lead to any immediate increased risk to Americans. It is no secret that the CIA used techniques amounting to torture in its interrogations after Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nWhat has raised the number of those inclined to cause harm to Americans is the torture itself, not its description in the Senate report.\n\nThe Case Of Zubaydah\n\nThe interrogation methods had already been called torture by courts and international organizations. Last summer, the European Court of Human Rights ordered Poland to pay monetary damages to Abu Zubaydah. He was captured in Pakistan in 2002 and believed to be a member of al-Qaida, the group behind the Sept. 11 attacks. He was tortured in Poland at a \u201cblack site\u201d the Polish government let the CIA use.\n\nThe court found that the methods used against Zubaydah were torture as it is defined by international law. The court found Poland also responsible in the torture committed by the CIA.\n\nIn the case of Zubaydah, harsh tactics including waterboarding \u2014 which creates the feeling of drowning \u2014 were used. Yet, the Senate report says it did not result in any significant information from him.\n\nThe United States has also been criticized by the U.N. Committee Against Torture. It monitors the Convention Against Torture, which we signed and are supposed to obey.\n\nWhat the Senate Intelligence Committee report confirmed, although in greater detail, is only what other groups have already found.\n\nWhat matters more to people in the rest of the world is our actions, not this new report.\n\nNew Generation Of Extremists\n\nThe torture was part of an overreaction to Sept. 11 that included the mistake of invading Afghanistan.\n\nInstead of dealing with Afghanistan's government to capture those responsible for the attacks in New York, we took over the country. Now we are trying to remove ourselves from Afghanistan. But we're leaving the country unstable, which is what let al-Qaida operate there to begin with.\n\nThe CIA torture was carried out, moreover, not only to discover threats from al-Qaida, but to prove that al-Qaida and Iraq were working together. We used this as an excuse to invade Iraq, but no such proof was ever found.\n\nIt is all these actions taken together that make us a target for a new generation of extremists. Not surprisingly, our actions are interpreted as arrogance.\n\nOur continuing position in the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians does not help. Even today, we stand practically alone in refusing to acknowledge Palestine as its own nation, and in protecting Israel in the U.N. Security Council.\n\nIt made sense to come clean on torture, in part because torture is a crime under U.S. law. The U.S. signed onto the Convention Against Torture, making torture committed anywhere in the world a crime.\n\nA Constitutional Responsibility\n\nCharles Taylor, son of the former Liberian president of the same name, is currently serving a 97-year sentence in an American prison. He orchestrated torture in Liberia when he headed a government \u201canti-terrorism\u201d unit under his father. Despite the crime taking place in another country, international law means he could be imprisoned here.\n\nRegardless of whether any American official is prosecuted, the Senate had to release this report about torture. It has a Constitutional responsibility in overseeing the actions of presidents, even if these actions happened in the past. In the long term, the safety of the United States will depend on how we deal with all our international issues, not just this one.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: John B.

They should see how the rest of the world sees us. Other nations watch and listen to whatever we say or do. Extremists in some of those countries do as well.\n\nThe cluelessness of lawmakers explains why it released the torture report now. It has been 13 years since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The report details the actions of the CIA. It is a spy agency that finds out information to prevent attacks on the U.S. It tried to get information out of suspects after that horrible attack. The report admits that the CIA tortured people.\n\nNow the report has been splashed across TV screens, newspapers and websites. It will put American lives at risk. It gives extremists one more reason to attack the U.S.\n\nCIA Told \"To Do Whatever It Could\"\n\nTo be clear, the report only gave us a few new details. We\u2019ve known for years how the CIA got information out of suspects.\n\nIn fact, news came out years ago about the CIA's actions. We knew then that they kept suspects from sleeping, chained them to walls and threatened them. At the time, the government and American people began to talk about whether the U.S. should ever torture people.\n\nWe even agreed on when torture makes sense. Most Americans believe that we should only use torture in a few cases. One situation would be if the United States knew an attack was about to happen that could kill many people.\n\nIt's been years since we decided this. Lawmaker Diane Feinstein wrote in the report that the days after Sept. 11 were scary. People believed that more attacks were coming.\n\nIn fact, Feinstein pointed out that, after Sept. 11, the CIA was encouraged \"to do whatever it could to prevent another attack.\u201d She even noted that Congress \u201cpushes\" the CIA \"to act quickly\" to stop attacks.\n\nGetting Important Information\n\nNow we realize that what we did was terrible. At the time, it seemed necessary.\n\nFeinstein said that she hopes the report will help in the future. She wants it to be a warning. She hopes it will make sure that the United States never does this again.\n\nBut extremist groups plot every day to attack America. The report gives them one more tool. They'll use it to rally their fighters and convince new ones to join them.\n\nThe report could also make it harder for the CIA to get information. We depend on spy information about extremists from countries in Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere. We need it to prevent attacks. Now, other governments and spy agencies may help us less.\n\nAmerica talked seriously about torture years ago. The report does not add anything new.

It is a good step. Americans want to know about all the ways our government has fought terror.\n\nHorrifying details are in the report. Even still, it is not likely to put Americans in danger. We already knew that the American spy agency, the CIA, used torture to get information from suspects after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nWhat makes people want to harm Americans is the torture itself. The Senate report changes nothing.\n\nTorture Is A Crime\n\nThe spy agency's actions had already been called torture around the world. Last summer, the European Court of Human Rights decided that the U.S. tortured Abu Zubaydah. He was a prisoner who was captured in 2002 and was thought to be an al-Qaida member. Al-Qaida was the group behind the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nCIA members tortured him using a technique that made him feel like he was drowning. It is called waterboarding. Yet, the report said that the CIA did not gain any important information from him.\n\nThe United States has also been criticized by the United Nations. The group is made up of almost all of the world's countries. The group tries to help countries work together to achieve peace. The U.S. signed the United Nations Convention Against Torture. It is a law which makes torture a crime anywhere in the world. Just like other countries that signed it, we are supposed to obey it.\n\nThe torture was part of how we acted after Sept. 11. Along with that was our mistake of invading Afghanistan.\n\nWe should have worked with Afghanistan's government to capture those responsible for the attacks in New York. Instead, we took over the country. Now we are leaving Afghanistan, but we're leaving it with a lot of conflicts going on. Al-Qaida will still be able to do its work there, just like it did before Sept. 11.\n\nThe Report Was Needed\n\nWe also invaded Iraq because we said al-Qaida and Iraq were working together. It wasn't true.\n\nIt is these actions that make us a target for extremists. We are seen as bullies.\n\nOur position in the fighting between Israel and the Palestinians does not help. Most countries recognize Palestine as a country. We do not. Extremists in the Middle East see this as another reason to hate us.\n\nCongress had to release this report about torture.

Other nations \u2014 and extremists in those nations \u2014 watch and listen closely to whatever we say or do.\n\nCluelessness is the only explanation for why Senate Intelligence Committee Democrats released such a violent report now. It has been 13 years since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The report describes how our spy agency, the CIA, used interrogation, or questioning, methods in the frightening months after that fateful day. It admits that our interrogation methods used torture.\n\nNow the details of this disturbing report have been splashed across TV screens, newspapers and websites. The publication of the report will, without a doubt, put American lives at risk. It gives extremists one more rallying cry to attack the U.S. It also forces other governments and their spy agencies to show that they\u2019re keeping their distance from us.\n\nYears After The Fact\n\nTo be clear, the report was revealing only in its raw detail of CIA activities against particular prisoners. We\u2019ve known for many years that the CIA used these methods.\n\nIn fact, news surfaced years ago about the CIA's actions. We knew then that they kept suspects from sleeping, chained them to walls, threatened them with horrible deaths and so on. At the time, the government and the American public began a serious national debate over whether the United States should ever torture.\n\nWe even reached a general agreement. Most Americans believe that we should avoid any torture except in the most extreme cases. An obvious situation is if the United States faced the immediate threat of an attack that could kill hundreds or thousands of people.\n\nNow it's years after the fact. Yet, as Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Diane Feinstein wrote in the report, the days after Sept. 11 were filled with fear that much greater attacks were coming.\n\nIn fact, Feinstein noted that, after Sept. 11, the CIA \u201cwas encouraged by political leaders and the public to do whatever it could to prevent another attack.\u201d She went on to write that the \u201cIntelligence Committee as well often pushes intelligence agencies to act quickly in response to threats and world events.\u201d\n\nThat, by the way, is no different than how our nation\u2019s leaders have behaved at other perilous times. During the Civil War, for instance, President Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus. The Latin phrase refers to a law that protects Americans from unlawful imprisonment. What later seems horrifying often seems necessary at the time.\n\nMore Attacks Against More Americans\n\nFeinstein says that she hopes the report will serve as a warning for the future. She hopes it will make sure that, even when facing danger, the United States never again abandons its values.\n\nBut extremists plot every day to attack America. The report gives them one more tool. They'll use it to rally their fighters and convince new ones to join them. That means more militants with more motivation to plot and launch more attacks against more Americans.\n\nNow, governments and intelligence agencies with which the U.S. works could hesitate before giving us information. We rely on intelligence information from our allies in Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere.\n\nWithout information to protect us from attacks, we'll be more open to plots.\n\nAmerica debated torture and made a decision years ago. Rather than add to that debate, the committee\u2019s report is just making American deaths more likely.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Lawrence J.

The methods used to wage the \u201cwar on terror\u201d are of great interest to the public.\n\nHorrifying details were included in the report about what was done to detainees. Despite those, the release is not likely to lead to any immediate increased risk to Americans. It is no secret that the CIA used torture in its interrogations after Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nWhat causes extremists to want to harm Americans is the torture itself. The Senate report changes nothing.\n\nU.S. Criticized By U.N.\n\nThe interrogation methods had already been called torture around the world. Last summer, the European Court of Human Rights determined that the CIA tortured Abu Zubaydah. He was captured in Pakistan in 2002 and was believed to be a member of al-Qaida, the group behind the Sept. 11 attacks. He was tortured in Poland at a site the Polish government let the CIA use.\n\nIn the case of Zubaydah, harsh tactics including waterboarding \u2014 which creates the feeling of drowning \u2014 were used. Yet, the Senate report says it did not help gain any significant information from him.\n\nThe United States has also been criticized by the United Nations for the CIA's interrogation methods. The U.S. signed onto the U.N. Convention Against Torture, a law, and we are expected to obey it.\n\nThe torture was part of an overreaction to Sept. 11 that included our mistake in invading Afghanistan.\n\nInstead of dealing with Afghanistan's government to capture those responsible for the attacks in New York, we took over the country. Now we are trying to remove ourselves from Afghanistan. But we're leaving the country a mess, which could let al-Qaida operate there once again.\n\nOur Arrogant Actions?\n\nThe CIA torture was carried out not just to discover threats from al-Qaida. It was also used to establish that al-Qaida and Iraq were working together, as an excuse to invade Iraq. No such connection was ever established.\n\nIt is all these actions taken together that make us a target for extremists. Not surprisingly, our actions are interpreted as arrogance.\n\nOur position in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians does not help. Even today, we are practically alone in refusing to acknowledge Palestine as its own country. Our position on the conflict gives extremists one more reason to hate us.\n\nIt made sense to come clean about torture. It is a crime under U.S. law, after all. The U.S. signed the U.N. Convention Against Torture, making torture committed anywhere in the world a crime.\n\nThe Senate had to release this report about torture. It has a role in overseeing the actions of presidents. In the long term, the safety of America will depend on how we deal with foreign policy issues overall, not just this one.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: John B.

It is clearly not.\n\nTrue \u201cnational security\u201d issues arise due to violent actions by humans, whether countries or extremist groups like al-Qaida.

Other types of challenges \u2014 be they bad bugs or bad weather \u2014 are just problems to be solved.\n\nThe challenge of keeping Ebola from becoming a global problem is truly not about security. Helping West Africa deal with Ebola is a humanitarian mission.\n\nStopping The Spread of Ebola\n\nIt is, of course, absolutely appropriate for the U.S. to provide humanitarian assistance when we have the means to do so and it's in our own interest.\n\nAmerica provided a huge humanitarian response to the 2004 Tsunami in Asia.\n\nFurther, the U.S. military undertakes these kinds of missions quite frequently, both at home and overseas. Be it sandbagging during storms or delivering supplies and rescue services after disaster strikes, our military is skilled at assisting in non-military emergencies. It is not the main job for our armed forces, but these are appropriate auxiliary missions \u2014 tasks to be done when U.S. troops are needed and available.\n\nDeciding when to launch these missions depends on if they are suitable, possible and acceptable.\n\nWithout question, the West African crisis is a suitable use of U.S. forces. The Pentagon can quickly send troops, experts and support to help local groups there stop the spread of the disease.\n\nAnd it's in our own interest.

But he's putting them at risk.\n\nLike many of Obama\u2019s foreign policy plans, he is acting without thinking through the problem.\n\nHere are reasons why sending our military isn\u2019t the best way to offer assistance:\n\nOur military is already taking on too much. The president has decided to cut the Army from 570,000 soldiers to 440,000. The administration\u2019s Quadrennial Defense Review said this \u201cstrains our ability\" to respond to more than one major military problem at a time.\n\nThat review came before the president announced plans to send 4,000 soldiers to West Africa. And that number is sure to grow with the president\u2019s recent decision to call up National Guard soldiers waiting on reserve. It was also before bombing missions were launched against the extremist group Islamic State, a campaign that may eventually require ground forces.\n\nSerious Risks To U.S. Soldiers\n\nIn light of these challenges, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno recently questioned the wisdom of continuing with the plan to reduce U.S. forces.\n\nSending troops to West Africa runs the risk that they'll get stuck there. Beyond the military\u2019s humanitarian role in the Ebola crisis, it would likely have to keep the peace as well.\n\nThe Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Janine Davidson noted, \u201cAs the disease spreads, so does panic \u2014 and panic leads to violence.\u201d Maintaining order in African countries will pose serious risks.\n\nFor one, it would require significantly more troops in the future, stretching our military even further. The World Health Organization forecasts new Ebola cases could rise by 10,000 per week by December. That could cause a lot of panic and violence that would need to be subdued.\n\nFor another, it could place our soldiers in an impossible position, such as one in which Liberian soldiers recently found themselves. They had to choose between their safety and the public\u2019s. Violent rioting triggered by a quarantine left four people wounded and one 16-year-old boy dead.\n\nImagine U.S. soldiers being forced to make the same choice: Having to shoot unarmed, possibly infected Liberians or allow Ebola to spread.\n\nDragged Into Disputes?\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) isn\u2019t ready. All of the Ebola patients who contracted the disease on U.S. soil were full-time health care professionals. They caught the disease while treating it using the instructions of the CDC. The CDC is not ready for such a task in Africa.\n\nBringing the military into humanitarian aid risks getting the U.S. dragged into disputes inside African countries. All three countries at the center of the Ebola outbreak have weak governments.\n\nSierra Leone and Liberia have just emerged from civil wars in the past few years. Guinea was ruled by the military until 2010. Both Liberia and Guinea have canceled upcoming elections. We\u2019re told these countries are so unstable that just banning U.S. travel to the countries could send them into chaos.\n\n\u201cYou isolate them, you can cause unrest in the country,\u201d said the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Anthony Fauci. \u201cIt\u2019s conceivable that government could fall.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Obama administration remains opposed to travel bans, the one measure that might provide Americans some protection.\n\nOur soldiers are being placed at enormous risk all because the president is unwilling stop the flow of possibly infected people from West Africa.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: David A.

Photo: AP Photo/Jerome Delay\nPRO: U.S. troops are unrivaled in carrying out humanitarian missions\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Barack Obama was right to dispatch U.S. military units to help combat an Ebola outbreak in West Africa. But he did it for the wrong reasons.\n\nObama called it a \u201cnational security\u201d mission \u2014 a clear misuse of the term. Americans should be wary of Washington\u2019s growing tendency to make every project a priority simply by appending \u201csecurity\u201d to the issue.\n\nNational security efforts by design are statist, centralized, top-down activities. So when the government says it wants to focus on climate security, energy security, food security, or any other pet project \u2014 what it is really saying is the government plans to step in and take over.\n\nFor most of life\u2019s challenges and hazards \u2014 even those where we might want the government to take some action \u2014 we certainly don\u2019t want Washington to take over.\n\nTrue \u201cnational security\u201d issues arise due to human-controlled actors \u2014 whether states or al-Qaida \u2014 that threaten the violent destruction of assets or interests vital to the United States. Other types of challenges \u2014 be they bad bugs or bad weather \u2014 are just problems to be solved.\n\nThe challenge of keeping Ebola from becoming a global problem is not principally a security problem. Helping West Africa deal with Ebola is a humanitarian mission \u2014 not a national security deployment.\n\nIt is, of course, wholly appropriate for the U.S. to provide humanitarian assistance when we have the means to do so and it does not conflict with America\u2019s interest.\n\nAmerica\u2019s humanitarian response to the 2004 Tsunami in the Asia-Pacific dwarfed the assistance provided by most countries.\n\nFurther, the U.S. military undertakes these kinds of missions quite frequently, both at home and abroad. Be it sandbagging during storms or delivering supplies and rescue services after disaster strikes, our military is skilled at alleviating non-military emergencies. It is not the principal job for our armed forces, but these are appropriate auxiliary missions \u2014 tasks to be done on an as-needed and as-available basis.\n\nThe right measure of these missions is whether or not they are suitable, feasible and acceptable.\n\nWithout question, the West African crisis is a suitable use of U.S. forces. The Pentagon can quickly deploy expertise, support and infrastructure that will help local organizations stop the spread of the disease.\n\nAnd there\u2019s self-interest here as well. The best way to keep more Ebola cases from checking in at the nearest Holiday Inn is to help quell the outbreak at its source. Alternative containment strategies \u2014 like banning travel and yanking visas \u2014 are much blunter instruments.\n\nThe West African deployment also passes the \u201cfeasible\u201d and \u201cacceptable\u201d tests. This is not to say the mission poses zero risks to our troops.\n\nEven medical professionals who presumably try to take all the right precautions have caught the disease. But, our troops are disciplined, and they should know the right risk-mitigation measures to take.\n\nThey are also brave, courageous and willing volunteers. They understand there is danger going in harm\u2019s way. That is part of the job.\n\nRather than just invoking the name of \u201cnational security\u201d and moving on, the White House should have classified the initiative correctly \u2014 as a humanitarian mission \u2014 and explained the rationale for this auxiliary mission to the American people.\n\nInstead all they got was a banal declaration and a ludicrous promise that Ebola would never appear on U.S. shores.\n\nWords are important, and so are actions. Mislabeling missions, as Obama did earlier in calling our offensive against the extremist group Islamic State a \u201chumanitarian\u201d mission, suggests a dangerous confusion about the nature of true national security risks and the principle function of our military.\n\nIt also raises concern about the conduct of this mission. Has the White House organized operations efficiently and sent enough assets to West Africa? Or is the president simply throwing some troops at the problem so he can say he\u2019s done something?\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: A 25-year Army veteran, James Jay Carafano is vice president of Defense and Foreign Policy Studies for The Heritage Foundation, (heritage.org), a conservative think tank on Capitol Hill.

But our soldiers aren\u2019t Hallmark greeting cards.\n\nLike many of Obama\u2019s foreign policy initiatives, his Ebola plan has a ready-shoot-aim quality to it.\n\nHere are reasons why our military isn\u2019t the best vehicle for rendering assistance:\n\nOur military is already overextended. The president has decided to cut the Army from its wartime high of 570,000 soldiers to 440,000.

It shows the world he cares enough to send our best people. But he's putting them at risk.\n\nLike many of Obama\u2019s plans, he is acting without thinking.\n\nHere are four reasons why sending our military isn\u2019t the best way to help:\n\nOur military is already doing too much. The president has decided to cut the Army from 570,000 soldiers to 440,000. A government study said this makes it difficult to deal with more than one large military problem at a time.\n\nA Dangerous Mission\n\nNow the president will send 4,000 soldiers to West Africa. And that number is sure to go up. The president just decided to call up National Guard soldiers, who are off duty. The U.S. is also now bombing the extremist group Islamic State. And our troops may need to go fight that group soon.\n\nThese are big challenges. Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno recently questioned the plan to cut the number of U.S. troops.\n\nOur troops risk getting stuck in West Africa. Besides giving humanitarian aid, our military might have to keep the peace as well.\n\nInternational affairs expert Janine Davidson said, \u201cAs the disease spreads, so does panic \u2014 and panic leads to violence.\u201d Keeping the peace in African countries could be risky.\n\nFor one, it would take many more troops in the future, stretching our military even further. The World Health Organization says there could be 10,000 new Ebola cases each week by December. That could cause a lot of panic and violence. Our troops would need to keep the peace.\n\nFor another, it could place our soldiers in a position like the one Liberian soldiers recently found themselves. They had to choose between their safety and the public\u2019s. A neighborhood was put under quarantine and people were not allowed to leave their homes. Violent rioting started. It left four people wounded and one 16-year-old boy dead.\n\nImagine U.S. soldiers being forced to make the same choice: Having to shoot unarmed, possibly infected Liberians or allow Ebola to spread.\n\nUnstable Countries\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) isn\u2019t ready. All of the Ebola patients who caught the disease on U.S. soil were health care workers. They caught Ebola while treating it and using the instructions of the CDC. The CDC is not ready to help in Africa.\n\nBringing the military into humanitarian aid risks getting the U.S. dragged into the problems inside West African countries. All three countries at the center of the Ebola outbreak have weak governments.\n\nCivil wars ended in Sierra Leone and Liberia not long ago. Guinea was ruled by the military until 2010. These countries could be so unstable that just stopping travel there from the U.S. could cause chaos.\n\n\u201cYou isolate them, you can cause unrest in the country,\u201d said the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Anthony Fauci. \u201cIt\u2019s conceivable that government could fall.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Obama administration still doesn't want to stop travel from West Africa. Yet, it's the one way that might give Americans some protection.\n\nOur soldiers face enormous risk. And it's all because the president is unwilling stop the flow of possibly infected people from West Africa.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: David A.

But he did it for the wrong reasons.\n\nObama called it a \u201cnational security\u201d mission \u2014 a clear misuse of the term. Americans should be wary of Washington\u2019s growing tendency to make every project a priority simply by adding the word \u201csecurity\u201d to the issue.\n\nNational security efforts must be controlled by the government, at the highest levels. So when our government says it wants to focus on climate security, energy security, food security \u2014 what it is really saying is that the government plans to step in and take over.\n\nFor most of life\u2019s challenges and hazards \u2014 even those where we might want the government to take some action \u2014 we certainly don\u2019t want Washington to take over.\n\nAn Appropriate Response\n\nTrue \u201cnational security\u201d issues arise due to actions by countries or extremist groups like al-Qaida that threaten the violent destruction of interests to the United States. Other types of challenges \u2014 be they bad bugs or bad weather \u2014 are just problems to be solved.\n\nThe challenge of keeping Ebola from becoming a global problem is not mainly a security problem. Helping West Africa deal with Ebola is a humanitarian mission.\n\nIt is, of course, entirely appropriate for the U.S. to provide humanitarian assistance when we have the means to do so and it does not conflict with America\u2019s interest.\n\nAmerica\u2019s humanitarian response to the 2004 Tsunami in the Asia-Pacific dwarfed the assistance provided by most countries.\n\nFurther, the U.S. military undertakes these kinds of missions quite frequently, both at home and abroad. Be it sandbagging during storms or delivering supplies and rescue services after disaster strikes, our military is skilled at assisting in non-military emergencies. It is not the principal job for our armed forces, but these are appropriate auxiliary missions \u2014 tasks to be done when U.S. troops are needed and available.\n\nThe right measure of these missions is whether or not they are suitable, possible and acceptable.\n\nWithout question, the West African crisis is a suitable use of U.S. forces. The Pentagon can quickly deploy expertise, support and infrastructure that will help local organizations stop the spread of the disease.\n\nDefeat Ebola At Its Source\n\nThere\u2019s self-interest here as well. The best way to keep more Ebola cases from checking in at the nearest Holiday Inn is to help defeat the outbreak at its source. Alternative ways of containing the outbreak \u2014 like banning travel and yanking visas \u2014 are much less targeted.\n\nThe West African deployment also passes the \u201cpossible\u201d and \u201cacceptable\u201d tests. This is not to say the mission poses zero risks to our troops.\n\nEven medical professionals who try to take all the right precautions have caught the disease. But, our troops are disciplined, and they should know the measures to take to lower their risk.\n\nThey are also brave, courageous and willing volunteers. They understand the danger. That is part of the job.\n\nRather than just appealing to \u201cnational security,\" the White House should have classified the operation correctly \u2014 as a humanitarian mission \u2014 and explained the reason for this auxiliary mission to the American people.\n\nWords are important, and so are actions. Mislabeling missions, as Obama did earlier in calling our offensive against the extremist group Islamic State a \u201chumanitarian\u201d mission, suggests a dangerous confusion about the nature of true national security risks and the principle function of our military.\n\nIt also raises concern about the conduct of this mission. Has the White House organized operations efficiently and sent enough troops to West Africa? Or is the president simply throwing some troops at the problem so he can say he\u2019s done something?\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: A 25-year Army veteran, James Jay Carafano is vice president of Defense and Foreign Policy Studies for The Heritage Foundation, (heritage.org), a conservative think tank on Capitol Hill.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed an introductory training course for licensed clinicians. Photo: AP Photo/Brynn Anderson\nPRO: A trio of culprits at heart of Obama administration's ineffective response\nARLINGTON, Va. \u2014 As the Ebola epidemic deepens in West Africa and has put U.S. citizens on alert, critics are increasingly questioning the Obama administration's response to the crisis. So far it has been ineffective.\n\nU.S. health officials have blamed the unfolding tragedy on not receiving enough money from lawmakers in Washington to fight the disease. That was bad enough.\n\nThe appointment of someone with flimsy medical qualifications as Ebola czar confirmed that the White House response is more political than responsible. It's just looking for a quick political fix, to seem like it has things under control.\n\nIn an hour of need, our various national and international public health administrators dropped the ball with deadly consequences. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) have all failed at their roles.\n\nThat's due to the way government health agencies generally spread around public resources. Several different health agencies receive money from the federal government and each are tasked with fighting the epidemic on the front line. But they've done a poor job coordinating their efforts.\n\nCDC Focuses On Political Concerns\n\nTake the CDC. Its mission is to \"develop and apply disease prevention and control.\" Yet that takes a backseat to more political concerns like fighting obesity and gun violence.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2014, CDC spending grew by almost 30 percent, from $8.3 billion to $10.7 billion a year.\n\nYet the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, whose job it is to prevent diseases like Ebola, received only roughly $400 million a year, a tiny sliver of total CDC funding.\n\nFunding for the CDC's climate change and chronic disease programs, which aim to prevent smoking, alcohol consumption and poor diets, receive roughly $1.6 billion each year.\n\nWhile these are real problems, they take resources and focus away from the CDC's original mission and away from responding to disease outbreaks.\n\nNIH Spends Money On Wrong Projects\n\nThe same is true at the NIH. Its director made inaccurate public statements blaming budget cuts for the its lack of preparedness, yet it has plenty of money.\n\nRecent NIH funding levels are actually higher than historically. In 2000, its total budget was $24.1 billion. By 2014, that grew by roughly 25 percent to $29.7 billion.\n\nMuch of NIH's budget goes to projects that have nothing to do with researching vaccines for emerging diseases like Ebola. Instead, its money goes to projects like studying the behavioral attributes of feces-flinging chimpanzees or designing condoms.\n\nBut funding for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH department that actually researches infectious diseases, has not gone up. It has remained at roughly $4.5 billion a year since 2003.\n\nThese are only symptoms of a deeper problem. In 2011, the Congressional Budget Office reported that NIH's broad range of activities, large staff and consecutive funding increases make \"inefficiencies and duplicative or wasteful efforts\" likely.\n\nWHO Didn't See \"Writing On The Wall\"\n\nThen there's the WHO.

Their thinking might also be that the Ebola horse has left the barn and our government, specifically the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is not riding it.\n\nFor others who have watched Ebola emerge, however, we see the involvement of the CDC, even without support from our lawmakers who haven't committed enough money to fight the disease.\n\nThe story of Ebola is truly one of a worldwide lack of public health infrastructure \u2014 health care workers, hospitals and equipment. There is also a lack of trust in working with African nations just emerging from war, and an exhausted health care workforce. There is also widespread wariness and avoidance of our duty as a global community to fight disease wherever it might be.\n\nWhen CDC Director Tom Frieden said our effort to beat Ebola lies in our ability to stop the epidemic in West Africa, he was not suggesting that we let others handle it.\n\nPublic Health Is Everyone's Concern\n\nIs the CDC doing a good job responding to Ebola? Yes, and they'll need our help. A short explanation about public health is in order.\n\nFirst, public health is our responsibility to assure the health of populations. CDC is our primary public health agency and, as such, it is our best weapon against international epidemics. However, it is not the U.S. agency in charge of our interaction with other countries.\n\nFact: Most of the public health presence around the world is nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), like Doctors Without Borders, which survive on donations from foundations and nations.\n\nCDC is an easy target for our frustrations or fears about Ebola because it is likely the only U.S. public health agency we know about. We are generally clueless to the many positive public health outcomes of its work such as clean water, air, safe workplaces, a trained health workforce and response to outbreaks.\n\nWe fail to notice that school-based measles and whooping cough outbreaks are quickly handled, thanks to local public health departments; or the progress made in reducing infections patients catch in hospitals.\n\nThe CDC's Quick Response In U.S.\n\nWe become aware of public health when something \"goes wrong,\" and then blame the government even when we shirked our duty as a public health community.\n\nOur ignorance was made clear by the mounting fear witnessed since Thomas Eric Duncan became known to us as the first Ebola patient in the U.S.\n\nThe CDC responded quickly, providing such resources as epidemic intelligence officers and public health advisers to find everyone who he came in direct contact with. It also provided hospital infection control procedures, detailed Ebola screening checklists, laboratory precautions, quarantine rules and is now managing the airport screening processes.\n\nAs Ebola was emerging in West Africa, CDC epidemiologists, doctors specialized in epidemics, were soon on the ground there investigating. CDC could increase important human resources for West Africa: hundreds of epidemiologists, health educators and public health advisers could be sent.\n\nIf we recognize anything about CDC's Ebola work, it is likely only that of crisis response. We do not see the longer term investment in sustainable public health infrastructure because we have not made this a national or international priority and committed the money to it.\n\nOur Complaints, Demands And Disinterest\n\nHas the CDC done a good job responding to the Ebola outbreak? Absolutely, and they are not done yet.\n\nHave we? No. Our complaints, demands to close our borders, paired with our almost complete disinterest to the challenge our friends in West Africa face, will likely be the barrier to success with Ebola or other emerging world health issues.\n\nTo be fully successful in our fight against Ebola, Americans must call upon their government to invest in sustained public health infrastructure here and in West Africa.\n\nThey must expect our U.S. hospitals to systematically train, prepare and supply the front-line health workers to recognize Ebola, protect themselves and control the spread. And they must support the nongovernmental organizations that are doing the work on the ground.\n\nThis is more than an emergency response, but a move toward public health infrastructure here and abroad. CDC is doing a good job, but they are not alone in this, and all Americans must engage fully as members of our global community.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Beth Meyerson is an assistant professor of health policy and management at Indiana University's School of Public Health, and is also the co-director of the Rural Center for AIDS/STD Prevention.

U.S. citizens are on alert after cases in this country. People are questioning how President Barack Obama has handled the crisis. So far he and his administration have not done enough.\n\nU.S. health officials blamed their mistakes in handling Ebola on not having enough money. They said lawmakers in Washington cut their spending too much to fight Ebola. That was bad enough.\n\nThen the White House appointed someone with little health knowledge to handle the U.S. fight against Ebola. This proved the White House is just looking for a quick fix to show that it is doing something.\n\nThe real problem is our national and international health agencies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) have all failed.\n\nPoor Job Of Working Together\n\nThat's due to the way government health agencies use their money and their workers. It is the job of several agencies to fight Ebola. They have done a poor job of working together.\n\nTake the CDC. Its mission is \"disease prevention and control.\" Yet it spends much of its money fighting ongoing problems like obesity and gun violence.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2014, CDC spending grew from $8.3 billion to $10.7 billion a year. Yet it has a department which just works to prevent diseases like Ebola. It received only about $400 million a year, a small fraction of the overall budget.\n\nThe CDC has a program to limit climate change. It has another to deal with ongoing health problems \u2014 preventing smoking, alcohol abuse and poor diets. Together those programs receive four times as much money as stopping diseases like Ebola.\n\nWhile those are real problems, they take away from the CDC's job of fighting disease outbreaks.\n\n\"Wasteful Efforts\"\n\nThe same is true at the NIH. Its boss said it didn't have enough money. Yet the NIH has plenty of money.\n\nThe NIH gets more now than it did a few years ago. In 2000, it had $24.1 billion to spend. By 2014, that grew to $29.7 billion.\n\nThe NIH also has a department that just studies diseases that people can catch. It gets just $4.5 billion a year to spend.\n\nMuch of NIH's money goes to projects that have nothing to do with discovering vaccines for diseases like Ebola.\n\nThere are deeper problems. In 2011, a government report found that because the NIH had so many programs, workers and money, \"wasteful efforts\" were likely.\n\nPoor Planning Can Be Deadly\n\nThen there's the WHO. In July, Doctors Without Borders asked it for more help. The group is one of the leading ones fighting Ebola in West Africa. The WHO ignored the request.\n\nA WHO document said that \"nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall.\"\n\nThe problem? The leaders of its African office didn't get their jobs because of their skills. They got them because they knew the right people. The WHO admitted this.\n\nThe co-discoverer of the Ebola virus, Dr. Peter Piot, agreed. He said the office in Africa \"didn't do anything.\"\n\nPoor government planning can be deadly in the worst of times, like a crisis.

Some people may think that our government is not doing its job. They may blame the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) because it is the main U.S. health agency.\n\nOthers, however, have seen the good work the CDC is doing.\n\nEbola's spread is about a worldwide lack of systems that support public health such as health care workers, hospitals and equipment. Health care workers fighting the outbreak are exhausted.\n\nWe have also not done our duty as part of a global community. It is our job to help fight disease outbreaks wherever they might be.\n\nMust Stop Ebola In West Africa\n\nCDC Director Tom Frieden said we must beat Ebola by stopping it in West Africa.\n\nIs the CDC doing a good job responding to Ebola? Yes, and they'll need our help. A short explanation about public health is needed.\n\nFirst, public health means making sure the U.S. is healthy, and it's a responsibility we all share. CDC is our main national health agency. As such, it is in charge of investigating disease. However, it is not in charge of dealing with disease in the rest of the world.\n\nFact: Most of the health work done around the world is by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), like Doctors Without Borders. These groups get money from charities and countries.\n\nCDC is an easy target. It is probably the only U.S. public health agency we know about. We are generally clueless to the many ways it protects our health. It aids with clean water, air, safe workplaces, training health workers and responding to disease outbreaks.\n\nWe fail to notice that measles outbreaks in schools are quickly handled. Progress has been made in reducing infections that patients catch in hospitals.\n\nCDC's Quick Response\n\nWe only become aware of public health when something \"goes wrong.\" Then we blame the government.\n\nFear has grown since Thomas Eric Duncan became the first Ebola patient in the U.S.\n\nThe CDC responded quickly. It sent health officers to find everyone who he came in contact with. It also provided steps to control infection in hospitals, created Ebola screening checklists, and quarantine rules for keeping diseased people separate. Now it is screening people at airports.\n\nAs Ebola emerged in West Africa, CDC experts were soon on the ground there investigating. CDC could still send hundreds of doctors and health workers to West Africa.\n\nHas CDC done a good job responding to the Ebola outbreak? Yes, and they are not done yet.\n\nHave we? No. We've just complained and made demands to close our borders.\n\nToward Better Health Programs\n\nTo be successful in fighting Ebola, our government must spend money on health here and in West Africa.\n\nOur U.S. hospitals must train health workers to recognize Ebola, protect themselves and control the spread of disease. And we must support the NGOs that are doing the work on the ground.\n\nThis is more than an emergency response. It is a move toward better health programs here and in other countries.

In 2000, its total budget was $24.1 billion. By 2014, that grew by roughly 25 percent to a more than adequate $29.7 billion.\n\nMuch of NIH's budget goes to projects that have nothing to do with researching vaccines for emerging diseases like Ebola \u2014 ones like studying the behavioral attributes of feces-flinging chimpanzees or \"facilitating a pleasurable and safe sexual experience for male\" by developing hand-rolled \"origami\" condoms.\n\nBut funding for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH department that actually researches infectious diseases, has retained stable levels of roughly $4.5 billion since 2003.\n\nThese are only symptoms of a deeper problem. In 2011, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that NIH's broad range of activities, large personnel and consecutive funding increases make \"inefficiencies and duplicative or wasteful efforts\" likely. The CBO concluded that NIH funding could be \"reduced or eliminated without harming high-priority research.\"\n\nThen there's the WHO, whose director ignored a plea for more support in West Africa from the highly effective Doctors Without Borders in July.\n\nThe Associated Press recently obtained a leaked private WHO document admitting that \"nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall.\"\n\nThe problem? WHO acknowledges its African office directors were \"politically motivated appointments\" unaccountable to leadership in Geneva.\n\nThe co-discoverer of the Ebola virus, Dr. Peter Piot, agreed, noting that \"the regional office in Africa didn't do anything.\" That office, he said, \"is really not competent.\"\n\nPoor government planning and unaccountability are wasteful and inefficient in the best of times, but the worsening Ebola crisis shows that they can be downright deadly in the worst of times.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) have all failed at their roles.\n\nSpending Its Money Unwisely\n\nThat's due to the way government agencies generally spread around public resources, like the money the receive from the government and their large staffs of health workers. The agencies whose job it is to fight the epidemic on the front line have also done a poor job of working together.\n\nTake the CDC. Its mission is to \"develop and apply disease prevention and control.\" Yet that takes a backseat to more political concerns like fighting obesity and gun violence.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2014, CDC spending grew by almost 30 percent, from $8.3 billion to $10.7 billion a year.\n\nYet its National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, which aims to prevent diseases like Ebola, receives roughly $400 million a year, just a tiny sliver of total CDC funding.\n\nThe CDC's climate change and chronic disease programs, which aim to prevent smoking, alcohol abuse and poor diets, receives roughly $1.6 billion each year.\n\nWhile these are real problems, they take away from the CDC's original mission and away from responding to disease outbreaks.\n\nPut The Money Into Research\n\nThe same is true at the NIH. Its director made inaccurate public statements blaming budget cuts for its lack of preparedness. In fact, the agency has plenty of money.\n\nThe amount of money the NIH gets from the U.S. government has actually risen. In 2000, its total budget was $24.1 billion. By 2014, that grew by roughly 25 percent to $29.7 billion.\n\nMuch of NIH's budget goes to projects that have nothing to do with researching vaccines for emerging diseases like Ebola. Instead, its money goes to projects like studying the behavior of feces-flinging chimpanzees or designing condoms.\n\nBut funding for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH department that actually researches infectious diseases, has not gone up. It has remained at roughly $4.5 billion a year since 2003.\n\nThese are only symptoms of a deeper problem. In 2011, the Congressional Budget Office reported that NIH's broad range of activities, large staff and back-to-back funding increases make \"wasteful efforts\" likely.\n\nWHO Fell Down On The Job\n\nThen there's the WHO. Doctors Without Borders, the group doing much of the work on the ground in West Africa, asked the WHO for help in July. The WHO ignored the request.\n\nThe Associated Press recently obtained a WHO document admitting that \"nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall.\"\n\nThe problem? Its African office leaders were appointed for political reasons not because of their skills. The WHO acknowledges this.\n\nThe co-discoverer of the Ebola virus, Dr. Peter Piot, agreed, saying that \"the regional office in Africa didn't do anything.\"\n\nPoor government planning and unaccountability are wasteful and inefficient in the best of times. As the Ebola crisis shows, they can be downright deadly in the worst of times. It's time our public health officials learned from these mistakes.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Veronique de Rugy is a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center (mercatus.org), a nonprofit education and research think tank at George Mason University.

Their thinking might also be that the Ebola horse has left the barn and our government, specifically the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is not riding it.\n\nFor others who have watched Ebola emerge, however, we see the good work the CDC is doing, even though our lawmakers don't support it with enough money.\n\nThe story of Ebola is truly one of a worldwide lack of public health infrastructure \u2014 health care workers, hospitals and equipment. There is a lack of trust in working with African nations which have just gotten out of wars. Health care workers fighting the outbreak are exhausted. We've also hid from our duty as a global community to fight disease outbreaks wherever they might be.\n\nCDC Director Tom Frieden said we must beat Ebola by stopping it in West Africa.\n\nThe Responsibility Of Us All\n\nIs the CDC doing a good job responding to Ebola? Yes, and they'll need our help. A short explanation about public health is in order.\n\nFirst, public health is our responsibility to assure the health of the nation. CDC is our primary national health agency and, as such, is in charge of investigating causes of disease. However, it is not the lead U.S. agency for fighting disease in the rest of the world.\n\nFact: Most of the health work done around the world is by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), like Doctors Without Border, which are run on donations from other groups and nations.\n\nCDC is an easy target for our fears around Ebola because it is likely the only U.S. public health agency we know about. We are generally clueless to the many health successes it's involved in such as clean water, air, safe workplaces, trained health workers and responses to outbreaks.\n\nWe fail to notice that measles outbreaks in schools are quickly handled, thanks to local public health departments; or the progress made in reducing infections acquired at hospitals.\n\nWhen Something \"Goes Wrong\"\n\nWe become aware of public health when something \"goes wrong,\" and then blame the government even when we dodged our duty to support public health.\n\nOur ignorance was made clear by the mounting fear since Thomas Eric Duncan became known to us as the first Ebola patient in the United States.\n\nThe CDC responded quickly, providing health officers to find everyone who he came in direct contact with. It also provided steps to control hospital infections, Ebola screening checklists, laboratory rules, quarantine rules and is now managing the airport screening processes.\n\nAs Ebola was emerging in West Africa, CDC epidemiologists, the doctors who study epidemics, were soon on the ground there investigating. CDC still could send hundreds of epidemiologists, health educators and public health advisers to West Africa.\n\nIf we recognize anything about the CDC's Ebola work, it is likely only that of crisis response. We do not see the longer term improvements in public health infrastructure because we have not made this a major goal and spent money to make it happen.\n\nTraining Front-Line Health Workers\n\nHas CDC done a good job responding to the Ebola outbreak? Absolutely, and they are not done yet.\n\nHave we? No. We've just complained and made demands to close our borders. Those actions, paired with our almost uncaring attitude toward West African nations facing the disease, will likely make it harder to stop Ebola.\n\nTo be successful in our fight against Ebola, Americans must call upon their government to spend money in public health infrastructure here and in West Africa.\n\nThey must expect our U.S. hospitals to train, prepare and supply the front-line health workers to recognize Ebola, protect themselves and control the spread. And they must support the NGOs that are doing the work on the ground.\n\nThis is more than an emergency response. It is a move toward public health infrastructure here and abroad. CDC is doing a good job, but they are not alone in this, and all Americans must engage fully as members of our global community.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Beth Meyerson is an assistant professor of health policy and management at Indiana University's School of Public Health, and is also the co-director of the Rural Center for AIDS/STD Prevention.

Its crime: not properly policing the private lives of two of its most well-known players.\n\nNo one is excusing Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice and Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson. Their behavior, and that of a handful of other NFL stars, has been outrageous.\n\nAbusing one's wife or child is a serious crime. It goes against our laws and our morals. People guilty of such crimes ought to receive stiff punishment. But this is America. They deserve a fair trial. It's likely they will be found guilty. If they are, they deserve punishments that fit their crimes.\n\nIn the meantime, let\u2019s get real. The NFL can urge its several thousand players to behave morally. However, it cannot watch them 24 hours a day without seriously violating their rights. It's the same as if we asked companies like NBC News, IBM, General Motors or Exxon Mobil to invade their workers\u2019 private lives.\n\nOne-Sided And Over-The-Top\n\nThese newspaper writers and TV reporters have appointed themselves as moral judges. They keep yelping for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to resign. They also want tough punishment against his league\u2019s 32 football teams.\n\nAll the players being punished are African-Americans. One can only wonder if there\u2019s a bit of racism behind it.\n\nYet the attack on professional football started long before Rice and Peterson became the media's favorite targets.\n\nThe Washington Post, led by its passionate opinion writers, has waged a war to get Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder to change his team\u2019s name. Snyder, to his credit, has strongly defended his First Amendment right to free speech.\n\nAttacks on the nickname make little sense. Repeated polling shows a large majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name Washington Redskins. Many even take pride in the team\u2019s portrayal of its mascot as noble, determined and strong. The support for the name is even stronger among the team\u2019s fans and other Americans.\n\nNearly every day the Post runs an article about the \u201coffensive\u201d Redskins name.

They want the Redskins name changed.

Sports writers and commentators dined out in the team\u2019s press box and were guests in the owner's sky box.\n\nNow all of a sudden they've changed course.\n\nEnough already! The chatter coming from the media and many in the Democratic Party could be an attempt to distract the public from President Barack Obama\u2019s failures.

Blaming the messenger may be the oldest play in the playbook. But that hasn't stopped defenders of football from blaming the media for all the trouble the National Football League is in.\n\nThe NFL is in real trouble. Choosing to blame the media only highlights the problems the league faces. Casual viewers and perhaps even the next generation of fans may drift away from the sport.\n\nIn a perfect world, breaking news wouldn't necessarily come to us from TMZ, blog blasts and ranting, angry commentators on cable TV. But the best days for serious news ended long ago.\n\nWhatever the source, there's no mistaking that Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice punched his future wife in an elevator. Then he dragged her body into the hotel corridor. There's no mistaking that the NFL has a serious problem when it comes to player violence. And no can deny there's a problem with the long-term health of its players because of concussions and other injuries.\n\nHead Injuries From A Violent Game\n\nFor a light can go out in a fan's heart. Not that long ago boxing and horse racing ranked among the top sports in the land. They drew huge crowds. Then the public decided that they were too crooked and, especially in the case of boxing, too violent.\n\nFootball is a violent game. We all know that. But it can be easily forgotten with the bright graphics, loud theme music and freeze-framed action offered to us from so many camera angles.\n\nBrain-related injuries are the most common injury in today's pro game.\n\nThe career expectancy for the average NFL player is 3.5 years, according to the union that represents its players. Wide receivers last only 2.81 years on average and running backs last even less at 2.57 years.\n\nSure, some players are cut from teams because somebody better came along. Yet the numbers strongly suggest that more end their careers due to injury.\n\nFor many, retirement soon becomes a nightmare. A new study reveals that nearly 30 percent of former NFL players will end up developing brain diseases like Alzheimer's or dementia because of head injuries.\n\nThe NFL Has Become A Mess\n\nWhat does all this medical evidence mean for youth leagues and high school teams?\n\nESPN recently polled parents. It found that 57 percent of parents said that stories about the increase in concussions from head injuries in football have made them less likely to allow their sons to play in youth leagues.\n\nPresident Barack Obama even said that if he had a son he would not let him play professional football.\n\nPop Warner is the largest youth football organization. From 2010 to 2012 it saw participation drop nearly 10 percent, ESPN reported. Roughly 60 percent to 70 percent of all NFL players started in the Pop Warner program.\n\nCan a sport remain at such a high level when fewer and fewer kids are playing it? Will the next generation choose a sport that's seen as so unhealthy to those who play it?\n\nToday's NFL has a lack of leadership, especially at the top.

But this is America. They deserve a fair trial and \u2014 in the likely event they are found guilty \u2014 appropriate punishments that fit their particular crimes.\n\nIn the meantime, let\u2019s get real. The NFL can urge its several thousand roster and taxi squad players to behave in a morally upright manner, but it cannot do 24-hour surveillance on them without seriously violating their civil liberties anymore than NBC News, IBM, GM or Exxon Mobil can ride herd on their workers\u2019 private lives.\n\nYet day after day the self-appointed moral arbiters of our lives keep yelping for the resignation of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and the application of tough sanctions against his league\u2019s 32 football teams. Since the players being punished are all African-Americans, one can only wonder if there\u2019s a faint aroma of racism in the air.\n\nYet it was open season on professional football long before Rice and Peterson emerged as media whipping boys.\n\nThe Washington Post, led by such passionate columnists as Mike Wise, Sally Jenkins and Robert McCartney, has conducted a lengthy campaign to badger Redskins owner Dan Snyder to change his team\u2019s nickname. Snyder, to his credit, has been steadfast in defending his First Amendment right to free speech.\n\nThe push to raise public consciousness began a few years ago \u2014 ironically, at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Indian \u2014 even though repeated polling shows a large majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name Washington Redskins and that many take pride in the team\u2019s depiction of its mascot as noble, resolute and strong. The support for the nickname is even stronger among Redskins\u2019 ticket holders and the general public.\n\nRarely a day goes by that the Post fails to highlight a story promoting one or another aspect of their drive to change the \u201coffensive\u201d name. The crusade is so intense and so one-sided that even less-than-alert readers have to wonder if they\u2019re being jobbed.\n\nJenkins in a recent column even urged Congress to \u201cstep in and regulate the business of these 32 billionaire plunderers.\u201d Fifty senators \u2014 all of them Democrats \u2014 have written to the NFL commissioner urging a name change. Given the legislative branch\u2019s job performance over the last decade, Jenkins\u2019 recommendation ought to give everyone particular pause.\n\nIronically, until the last few years, the Redskins enjoyed almost fawning support from the Post and other D.C. media. Sports writers and commentators dined out in the team\u2019s press box, and a host of Washington media celebrities were guests in the owner's sky box and were often highlighted on national TV.\n\nEnough already! One suspects that the chorus of pious rhetoric emanating from the left-wing media and many in the Democratic Party is merely an attempt to distract the public from the shortcomings of President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign and domestic policies.\n\nH.L. Mencken, the iconoclastic sage of The Baltimore Sun, once defined puritanism as \u201cthe haunting fear that someone, somewhere may be happy.\u201d\n\nSo it is with the anti-football harpies.

The Soviet Union was a huge country in which Russia ruled over Ukraine and many Eastern European countries.\n\nWeak Actions Won't Stop Russia\n\nPutin won\u2019t be stopped by the weak actions of the U.S. and Western Europe. So far, they've only put in place weak trade blocks to prevent countries and businesses from buying and selling with Russia. Threatening slightly tougher trade blocks won't do anything.\n\nIt\u2019s important to take action because Putin is not just after Ukraine. Now he\u2019s threatening Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania.

NATO members swear to protect one another.\n\nWhat Putin is doing threatens global peace.\n\nOnly U.S. military aid to Ukraine could possibly stop Putin.

It cut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine, which it needs for heating homes and buildings. Russia then forced Ukraine to let the separatists rule over the area of Ukraine they had taken.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko wants weapons to fight these pro-Russia separatists and is asking the U.S. for help.\n\nPresident Barack Obama will give military aid to Ukraine. But it won't include weapons. Obama is right to not give weapons to Ukraine's government.\n\nThere is a deal to stop fighting between Ukraine's government and the separatists. For now the sides aren't fighting much.\n\nThe separatists control some of Ukraine's largest eastern cities. Warfare there has wrecked parts of eastern Ukraine. If the cease-fire stops the fighting, the war will not continue. Giving Ukraine weapons would risk making the situation there worse. It would come at a time when matters seem to be getting fixed.\n\nIt's Not About U.S. And Russia\n\nPoroshenko has just made an important deal. He passed a law to let the separatists have more control over the areas they have taken. That law, along with the cease-fire, could end the fighting.\n\nObama\u2019s decision does not satisfy everyone in Congress. A Senate committee has called for weapons to give to Ukraine's government. But what the U.S. should now do is to keep up the cease-fire. It also should make sure the new law is put in place.\n\nThat law is a good first step. It gives the population in eastern Ukraine more freedom to run their areas. It would let the people there keep the close ties that they've always had with Russia.\n\nSome people think the law is a win for Russia and a loss for the U.S. The situation shouldn't be about the U.S. and Russia. The goal should be to do what is best for Ukraine.\n\nEnding The Bloodshed In Ukraine\n\nIt will not be easy. The new law doesn't say exactly which parts of eastern Ukraine are involved. It also doesn't say how much freedom the people will have to run the area.\n\nKnowing what the people in eastern Ukraine want is also unclear. One group of the easterners want nothing to do with Ukraine's government. This is the opinion of the separatists. But a second group in eastern Ukraine is comfortable with being ruled by Ukraine's government. And perhaps a third group just wants peace.\n\nOne important part of the new law is that it allows the Russian language to be used publicly in eastern Ukraine. Russian could be spoken there in schools, courts and government. That is a good step.\n\nIt is not clear what kind of relationship eastern Ukraine will have with Russia. Russia took over Crimea earlier in the year. The same thing probably won't happen to eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian government and the separatists have to work out a plan to please everyone.\n\nThe United States should help make that happen. There is every reason to believe that a plan can be reached to end the bloodshed in Ukraine.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: John B.

President Barack Obama said no to the request, and he was right to do so.\n\nObama let Poroshenko speak to Congress when he visited Washington. When Poroshenko asked for weapons, lawmakers clapped. But in a meeting just after, Obama turned Poroshenko down. Obama will give military aid to Ukraine that doesn't include weapons.\n\nThere is a cease-fire deal to stop the fighting in Ukraine. The deal was made between its government and the separatists. The separatists hold the major eastern cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. If the cease-fire holds to stop the fighting, the warfare that has wrecked some parts of eastern Ukraine will not continue.\n\nGiving Ukraine weapons would risk making the situation there worse. It would come at a time when matters seem to be getting fixed.\n\nA Good First Step\n\nPoroshenko has just made an important deal. He passed a law to let the separatists have more freedom to rule the areas they control. That law, along with the cease-fire, could be the way out of the deadly conflict.\n\nObama\u2019s decision to not send weapons to Ukraine upsets some people in Congress. A Senate committee has called for the U.S. to give weapons to Ukraine's government. But what the United States should now do is to help the cease-fire hold and make sure the new law goes into effect.\n\nThat law is a good first step. It gives the population in eastern Ukraine more control over local affairs. It will allow the people there to keep the close ties that they've always had with Russia.\n\nWhen it comes to what the U.S. should do, the spotlight has been on the differences between U.S. and Russia. It's easy to see anything that looks like a gain for Russia as a loss on the U.S. side.\n\nPromoting Peace\n\nBut the goal should be to do what is best for Ukraine.\n\nIt will not be easy. The new law doesn't say exactly which parts of eastern Ukraine are involved, and just how much freedom the people will have to govern themselves.\n\nKnowing what the people in eastern Ukraine want is unclear as well. One group of the easterners want nothing to do with Ukraine's government. This is the opinion of the separatists. But a second group in that same part of Ukraine is comfortable with being ruled by Ukraine's government. And perhaps a third group just wants peace.\n\nOne important piece of the new law is that the Russian language can be used publicly in eastern Ukraine, such as in schools, courts and local government. That is a good step.\n\nJust what kind of relationship eastern Ukraine will have with Russia remains to be worked out. A takeover by Russia \u2014 as happened earlier in the year in Crimea \u2014 is not likely to happen for eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian government and the separatists have to work out a solution to please everyone.\n\nThe United States should promote that process. There is every reason to believe that an acceptable arrangement can be achieved that will end the bloodshed in Ukraine.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: John B.

Photo: AP Photo/Mykola Lazarenko, Pool\nPRO: U.S. military aid to Ukraine would give Putin pause\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Congress has an opportunity to push the United States in a more effective direction with regard to Ukraine. Republican and Democratic lawmakers should approve legislation put forward in the Senate that would give Ukraine $350 million in military aid. It needs the aid to help it fight Russia from taking more of its land.\n\nRussia took Crimea from Ukraine in March. Many people in Crimea are ethnically Russian and speak Russian. Some wanted to separate from Ukraine, and began to fight Ukraine's government. Russia backed these separatists as they began their attacks. Then Russian troops invaded Ukraine and seized control of Crimea.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin dreams of bringing back the Soviet empire. He wants to go back to the era when Russia ruled over Eastern Europe, including Ukraine. He scoffs at U.S. and European actions to stop him.\n\nPutin won\u2019t be stopped from seizing more of Ukraine and plotting his next moves by the weak actions of the U.S. and Western Europe. So far, they've only put in place weak sanctions to prevent countries and businesses from trading with Russia. Threatening somewhat tougher sanctions won't do anything.\n\nStopping Putin\n\nThat\u2019s important because Putin is not just carving up Ukraine. No, increasingly, he\u2019s threatening the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. All of those countries are now members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance led by the U.S. and Western Europe.\n\nMore broadly, Putin is threatening world peace.\n\nOnly U.S. military aid to Ukraine\u2019s weakened government could possibly stop Putin. So far we\u2019ve given just non-military aid. As Ukraine\u2019s President Petro Poroshenko told Congress recently with regard to U.S. non-military aid, \u201cBlankets and night-vision goggles are important. But one cannot win a war with blankets.\u201d\n\nFar from disturbing Putin, the West\u2019s actions so far have only encouraged him to push ahead.\n\nSanctions Aren't Working\n\nAfter Russia took Crimea, in an unfairly run election Crimeans voted 95.5 percent to join Russia. U.S. and European leaders called the election illegal. Then they imposed limited sanctions blocking some Russian trade, and conducted military exercises in the area. None of those actions stopped Putin.\n\nThen, Russia aided pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, sent troops and arms across the border and cut off natural gas supplies on which Ukraine relies heavily. Russia then forced Ukraine to give the separatists self-rule over their area of Ukraine as part of a cease fire deal that was to stop the fighting. Not surprisingly, Russian separatists have already violated it.\n\nPresident Barack Obama vowed to Russia that \u201cthere will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine.\u201d The United States and Europe ramped up sanctions and Obama visited Estonia to show U.S. support for the Baltics. Again, Putin barely noticed.\n\nRegarding the Baltics, a top Russian official recently complained of discrimination against ethnic Russians and the Russian language. He's clearly laying the groundwork for a Ukraine-like intervention in those countries.\n\nIn addition, Russia seized an Estonian official along their shared border and charged him with spying. It also captured a Lithuanian fishing ship, claiming that it had sailed into Russian waters. Even worse, Russia asked Lithuania to send 1,500 former Soviet citizens there to Russia. Supposedly, they hadn\u2019t fulfilled their military service during the Soviet Union.\n\nWest Can't Be Weak\n\nWeak Western action is just encouraging Putin. In mid-September, Russian nuclear bombers flew within 63 miles of Alaska\u2019s coast and 46 miles of Canada\u2019s. The action forced U.S. and Canadian jets to fly out and meet them.\n\nSuch Russian brashness comes at the same time the country is upgrading its nuclear arsenal with new missiles, submarines and a new bomber; test-firing new missiles; and strengthening its forces and bases in the Arctic.\n\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the $350 million in aid for Ukraine on Sept. 18. Congress should quickly vote on it. Then President Obama should sign it.\n\nOtherwise, we\u2019ll surely see more bold Russian attacks in Ukraine and beyond. They\u2019ll only let Putin further chip away at global peace.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: A former communications director for Vice President Al Gore, Lawrence J.

But for that to happen, there must be recognition that parents know what\u2019s best for their children. Neither first lady Michelle Obama nor Congress should think they do.\n\nUnfortunately, the school meal standards that started to go into effect two years ago under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 ignore parents. Instead, the standards favor a federal government that thinks it knows everything.\n\nThose who dare to speak against these standards have quickly felt the wrath of Obama and her supporters.\n\nIt\u2019s not just politicians who have felt the anger of the first lady. The School Nutrition Association, representing more than 55,000 school nutrition experts, sent a letter to the first lady expressing \u201cdisappointment.\" The group said some of her comments put down school nutrition professionals.\n\nToo Much Government Control\n\nThe new meal standards try to control everything about what\u2019s served to children. They place severe restrictions on calories, nutritional content and portion sizes. Some schools have left the program. They'd rather sacrifice the massive amounts of money it offers in exchange for freedom from its excessive restrictions.\n\nOur federal government believes it must control nutritional policy in the schools. It assumes parents can\u2019t be trusted to teach their children how to make dietary choices that meet their unique needs.\n\nPeople who support Obama's food policy claim that parents need help because they can\u2019t ensure their kids are eating properly at school. Of course, parents can\u2019t know every single thing that their children eat at school. Yet this doesn\u2019t mean parents haven\u2019t taught their children how to make the right choices. But even assuming that schools need to limit food choices, this doesn\u2019t make government control right.\n\nParents concerned about the food provided to their children at school are much better off going to local officials to address these issues. They will generally get the chance to meet with the officials and have their voices heard.\n\nParents aren\u2019t going to get very far trying to convince D.C. politicians about their concerns. Officials have their hands tied with these new standards because they don\u2019t have the flexibility to address many concerns.\n\nGreater Flexibility Needed\n\nIf the new standards provided greater flexibility to states and local governments, it would help officials better meet the needs of their students. Not only that, but it would also give parents a greater say in the food provided through meal programs.\n\nThe federal standards have faced criticism from nutrition officials as well as students. The independent Government Accountability Office surveyed state nutrition officials. It found that local school food authorities had real concerns about the lunch standards, ranging from uneaten food to the costs of meeting the new standards.\n\nThe School Nutrition Association has echoed these concerns. The National School Board Association cautioned, \u201cSchool boards cannot ignore the higher costs and operational issues created by the rigid mandates of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act.\u201d Some schools have reportedly even taken money away from teacher pay to cover the extra costs.\n\nWorse, students are disgusted by the food provided to them. According to the GAO report, students in one district held a three-week boycott, refusing to eat school lunches. Students are posting their anger over the program using Twitter at \u201c#ThanksMichelle.\u201d\n\nThe first lady and other proponents of the standards haven't listened to complaints. They\u2019ve even opposed giving some poorer schools a one-year break from obeying the standards. Nothing, it seems, will be allowed to slow it from taking effect.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a shame. Washington always hungers for power, but these federal meal standards aren\u2019t fit for public consumption. They need to be scrapped.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Daren Bakst is a research fellow in agricultural policy at The Heritage Foundation, (heritage.org), a conservative think tank on Capitol Hill.

She has a new plan to make school lunches healthier. It is based on science and nutrition.\n\nThe first lady wants to improve children's health through better eating and more exercise.\n\nAmerica has a weight problem. Many people aren't just overweight, they are obese. Childhood obesity is a national problem: In 2012, 1 in 3 American children were overweight or obese. Overweight children may develop diseases, including heart disease and diabetes.\n\nThe U.S. has had a national school lunch program since 1946. It helps pay for school meals. More than 30 million students benefit from it. Yet over the past 15 years, the program hasn\u2019t changed much. Obama wants to update it as part of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act.\n\nFewer Calories, More Whole Grains\n\nThe Institute of Medicine is a group of scientists and health experts. It has pushed for healthier school meals. It recommends meals containing fewer calories, less fat and salt, and more fruit, vegetables and whole grains. Most parents would agree these are excellent goals.\n\nThe new law also makes it easier for poor kids and foster kids to have school meals. It helps pay for their meals.\n\nHowever, the government only sets guidelines. Each school system then makes its own menus. You also shouldn't believe ridiculous rumors. No matter what people say, there is nothing in the law that prevents bake sales or birthday cakes in the classroom.\n\nStill, there have been small problems. For instance, many high school athletes needed more protein than the guidelines allowed, so the government changed the rules.\n\nMost school systems are working with the rules. Nine out of every 10 now meet the new guidelines. Studies show most kids now like the new, healthier choices.\n\nKids Will Enjoy Healthy Food\n\nBut, some people don't want to improve the law. They just want to attack it. Health food supporters think junk-food sellers want to stop the new rules. They say junk-food sellers are trying to push our leaders in Congress to stop any changes in the law. There have been talks in Congress to hold off on the new nutritional rules for a year.\n\nKids avoid healthy food, but with enough time they come to enjoy it. School systems that made the changes slowly found students more ready to accept them.\n\nThe government has given food and money to our schools to improve student nutrition for years. It has been good for the kids, good for education and good for our country. Over the years, aid has helped kids afford breakfast as well as lunch.\n\nObama\u2019s plan is just the newest effort to make sure our kids eat right at school. Every parent should support it.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: William Rice is a policy specialist with Americans for Democratic Action (www.adaction.org), the nation\u2019s oldest liberal advocacy organization.

To do that, parents must be allowed to decide what\u2019s best for their children. First lady Michelle Obama has pushed for new changes to the program. She seems to think our government knows better than parents.\n\nUnfortunately, new school meal rules ignore parents. The first lady pushed for the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. Its new rules started to go into effect two years ago.\n\nMany people do not agree with the rules.\n\nThe School Nutrition Association represents more than 55,000 school nutrition experts. It sent a letter to the first lady expressing \u201cdisappointment.\" The group said she made comments that put down school nutrition workers.\n\nWorries About Wasted Food\n\nThe new meal rules try to control everything about school meals. They control calories, nutrition in meals and meal sizes. Some schools have left the program. They would rather not get the huge amounts of money the government offers, to avoid all the government's rules.\n\nOur government claims that parents need help. It believes parents can\u2019t make sure their kids eat properly at school. Of course, parents can\u2019t know every single thing that their children eat at school. Yet this doesn\u2019t mean parents haven\u2019t taught their children how to make the right choices.\n\nThe new rules don\u2019t let states and school leaders have enough say. They don't give them the freedom to deal with the concerns of parents.\n\nIf they did, it would help officials better meet the needs of their students. Not only that, but it would also give parents more say in the food provided through meal programs.\n\nThe rules have been criticized by nutrition experts. The Government Accountability Office investigates issues for the government. It surveyed state nutrition officials. It found that officials had concerns about the lunch rules. There were worries about wasted food and the costs of meeting the new rules. The rules make lunches cheap for students, but they cost schools money.\n\nStudents Don't Like The Lunches\n\nThe National School Board Association said, \u201cschool boards cannot ignore the higher costs\" created by the rules. Some schools have reportedly even taken money away from teacher pay to cover the extra costs.\n\nWorse, students are disgusted by the food provided to them.

Cataclysmic events drove the first five mass extinctions in Earth\u2019s history. An asteroid ended the age of the dinosaurs. Volcanic eruptions may have caused the Great Dying, which wiped out much of the earth's marine life at the time.\n\nAltogether, the five mass extinctions caused 75 percent of the planet\u2019s life to die out. The sixth mass extinction may now be beginning \u2014 and we're the cause of this one.\n\nDuring the last several centuries we have burned through eons worth of fossil fuels, like oil, coal and natural gas. In the process, we've changed the climate. We use more than half of the planet\u2019s unfrozen land for cities and logging or food, eliminating the habitats of animals and plants. Before we even achieved civilization, we had already helped hunt the biggest, fiercest animals \u2014 woolly mammoths, giant kangaroos and giant sloths \u2014 to extinction.\n\nThe \"Anthropocene Defaunation\"\n\nBiologists and paleoecologists (who study ancient ecosystems) estimate that humans have driven roughly 1,000 species extinct in our 200,000 years on the planet. Since 1500, we have killed off at least 322 types of animals. The passenger pigeon, the Tasmanian tiger and, most recently, the baiji, a freshwater dolphin in China are all gone forever.\n\nAnother 20,000 or more species are now threatened with extinction, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which keeps a list of all the known endangered plants and animals on the planet. There are 5 million or so animal species on the planet, and thanks to humans they are all 28 percent smaller on average. And as many as one third of all animals are either threatened or endangered, a new study in Science magazine finds.\n\nScientists call this sixth mass extinction the \"Anthropocene defaunation.\" The Anthropocene is a name some geologists use to mark the period of time that humans have dominated the Earth \u2014 and changed it.\n\nScientists can't be sure how quickly it's happening, perhaps because much of it is happening to beetles and other insects that are notoriously overlooked. But according to that new study in Science, their numbers fell by half over the past 35 years while the human population doubled. Other recent studies suggest that the current extinction rate is roughly 1,000 times faster than the average pace in Earth's history. That makes this the fastest extinction event on record, even if it is not yet a mass die-off.\n\nIt's Not Too Late\n\nThe biggest, fiercest animals still left on the planet \u2014 elephants, tigers, whales, among others \u2014 are most at risk. And we humans have shown no desire to stop the activities \u2014 overexploitation for food, habitat destruction and others \u2014 that drive extinction.\n\nAnd yet it's not too late. In the past few decades, humans brought the black-footed ferret back from just seven individuals; condors have been nursed back through vaccinations and raising by hand; and hellbender salamanders have been restored, to name just a few in North America. According to another new study in Science, people have physically moved 424 species of plants and animals to protect them from extinction.\n\nFor such efforts to succeed, careful attention must be paid both to genetics and habitat. There is no point in bringing back the baiji dolphin, for example, if the Yangtze River remains polluted and overfished. But conservation efforts can work. Fishes can bounce back when overfishing is stopped, just as Maine haddock and Washington state coho salmon both have. The reforesting of the U.S. East Coast shows that when farms go away, woodlands return. Then coyotes, deer, turkey and other wildlife move back in. The animals and plants of the Amazon rain forest have benefited from Brazil's efforts to curb deforestation.\n\nAnd in what might provide a lesson in conservation, paleoecologists have shown that 20 out of 21 large mammals in India \u2014 from leopards to muntjac deer \u2014 have survived there for the past 100,000 years alongside one of the largest human populations on the planet.\n\nConservation Is The Key\n\nTo avoid the sixth mass extinction we will probably have to be more aggressive about conservation. Endangered species may need to be moved to help them deal with a changing climate. Think re-wilding: reintroducing species like wolves or beavers that were once in a given ecosystem but have since disappeared. Aggressive conservation might also mean killing off newcomer species to preserve or make room for local plants and animals, as in New Zealand, where killing off local rats have helped non-flying kakapo parrots survive.\n\nIn the most extreme case aggressive conservation could involve bringing in new animals to fill the role of animals that have gone extinct. For example, European sailors ate their way through the Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius, killing off the dodo bird and the local tortoise species. But tortoises from the neighboring Seychelles archipelago have been imported recently. They have helped restore the island ecosystem, including bringing back the endangered local ebony trees. Similar projects are now being considered from Caribbean islands to Madagascar.\n\nThere is even some hope of bringing back entirely extinct species in the future using advances in genetics and synthetic biology. Bringing back extinct species, or replacing extinct animals with similar ones to restore ecosystems, could cause some of the same problems as invasive species, like the Asian carp invading U.S. lakes. We'll have to be careful.\n\nBut we are not doomed to cause a sixth mass extinction, at least not yet, despite consuming our way through the world's remaining big wild animals. Based on an estimate published in Nature in 2011, at our current rate we have a century or two before our actions assure a mass extinction.

About one third of them are either threatened or endangered, says a new study in Science magazine.\n\nScientists aren't sure how quickly it's happening. Maybe that's because tiny insects are most of what's dying out. The study in Science says their numbers fell by half in just the past 35 years. At the same time, humans have doubled in population.

Humans have already rescued some species. The black-footed ferret was brought back from just seven left. Condors have been nursed back through medicine and raised by hand.

Salmon in Washington state already have. When we stop farming too much, woods grow back. Then coyotes, deer, turkey and other wildlife return. Animals and plants in the Amazon rain forest do better now that Brazil cuts down fewer trees there.\n\nWe could learn from India. Scientists say that 20 out of 21 large mammals in India have survived. Leopards and deer are among them. For the past 100,000 years, they've lived alongside humans.\n\nPeople Can Still Change Course\n\nOur climate is changing. Endangered species could be moved to save them. Species like wolves or beavers have left their old ecosystems. They could be brought back. Some species have entered new areas and caused problems. Asian carp have invaded lakes in the U.S., eating everything. They may need to be killed to save other plants and animals.\n\nIn some cases new animals could be brought in. They could replace extinct animals. For example, European sailors ate their way through the Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius. They killed off the dodo bird and local turtles. But turtles nearby have been brought in. They helped bring back the island ecosystem.\n\nThere is even some hope of bringing back extinct species in the future. Biology and genetics could make it possible. Yet bringing back extinct species could cause problems for ones now. It could be like the Asian carp problem. We have to be careful.\n\nBut a sixth mass extinction can be avoided. A study in Nature magazine in 2011 said we have 100 to 200 years before we might cause a mass extinction.

The sixth mass extinction may now be beginning \u2014 and we're the cause of this one.\n\nDuring the last several centuries, we have constantly burned fossil fuels, like oil, coal and natural gas. In the process, we've changed the climate for other species. We use more than half of the planet\u2019s unfrozen land for cities and logging or food. Through our actions we have destroyed the natural habitats of animals and plants.\n\nHumans have existed for 200,000 years on Earth. Biologists and paleoecologists (who study ancient ecosystems) estimate that humans have driven roughly 1,000 species extinct. Early man hunted the biggest animals \u2014 woolly mammoths, giant kangaroos and giant sloths \u2014 to extinction. Since 1500, we have killed off at least 322 types of animals. The passenger pigeon and the Tasmanian tiger are all gone. Most recently, the baiji, a freshwater dolphin in China, was wiped out.\n\nAnimals Threatened Or Endangered\n\nAnother 20,000 or more species are now threatened with extinction, says the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. There are 5 million or so animal species on the planet. Humans have cut each of their numbers by 28 percent. And as many as one third of all animals are either threatened or endangered, a new study in Science magazine finds.\n\nScientists call this sixth mass extinction the \"Anthropocene defaunation.\" The Anthropocene is a name some geologists give to the period of time that humans have ruled the Earth \u2014 and changed it.\n\nNo one is sure how quickly it's happening, perhaps because much of it is happening to tiny insects. But according to the study in Science, their numbers fell by half over the past 35 years. At the same time, the human population doubled. Other recent studies suggest that species are becoming extinct roughly 1,000 times faster than normal throughout Earth's history.\n\nThe biggest animals on the planet \u2014 elephants, tigers, whales \u2014 are most at risk.\n\nConservation Can Work\n\nAnd yet it's not too late. Humans have helped save some species. The black-footed ferret was brought back from just seven left. Condors have been nursed back through vaccinations and raised by hand. According to another new study in Science, people have moved 424 species of plants and animals to protect them from extinction.\n\nConservation can work. Fishes can bounce back when we stop overfishing. Both Maine haddock and Washington state coho salmon have. On the East Coast of the U.S., when we stop farming the land, woodlands return. Then coyotes, deer, turkey and other wildlife move back in. The animals and plants of the Amazon rain forest have benefited from Brazil's efforts to stop deforestation.\n\nWe could learn a lesson from India. Paleoecologists found that 20 out of 21 large mammals in India \u2014 from leopards to muntjac deer \u2014 have survived there for the past 100,000 years. During that time, they've lived alongside one of the largest human populations on the planet.\n\nUnlike Asteroids, People Can Change Course\n\nTo avoid the sixth mass extinction we will probably have to push harder for conservation. Endangered species may need to be moved to help them survive the changing climate. Think re-wilding: bringing back species like wolves or beavers that were once in a certain ecosystem. Some species that have entered new areas may need to be killed to save local plants and animals; in New Zealand, killing off local rats have helped kakapo parrots survive.\n\nIn the most extreme case new animals could be brought in. They could replace animals that have gone extinct. For example, European sailors ate their way through the Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius. They killed off the dodo bird and the local turtle species. But turtles from the neighboring Seychelles archipelago have been imported recently. They have helped restore the island ecosystem.\n\nThere is even some hope of bringing back entirely extinct species in the future. Advances in genetics and biology could make it possible. Bringing back extinct species could cause problems, as could replacing extinct animals with similar ones to restore ecosystems. Right now, invasive species are hurting ecosystems. Asian carp have invaded lakes in the U.S., eating everything and wrecking the ecosystem. We'll have to be careful.\n\nBut a sixth mass extinction can still be avoided. Based on an estimate in Nature in 2011, we have a century or two before our actions assure a mass extinction. Unlike an asteroid, we could change course.\n\nSign up for a free account to read the full article.\nSign Up Sign In"}, {"1000L": "PRO/CON: \"Trigger warnings\" in the college classroom\nBy McClatchy-Tribune, adapted by Newsela staff\n09.14.14\n\nStanford University law degree student Cassandra Kildow asks a question during Bob Gordon's law class, Sept. 24, 2013, in Stanford, California.

Though not entirely uncontroversial, trigger warnings generally don\u2019t spark much rancor in online spaces. Some writers use them, most don\u2019t, but they usually pass without much comment either way.\n\nEarlier this year, though, when college students started pushing for the use of trigger warnings in classes, their demand provoked a massive, vitriolic and overwhelmingly negative response.\n\nUnlike most faculty, though, I found the idea intriguing. As a historian I discuss some very dark and difficult material in class, and as a professor I think it\u2019s important to give students a clear sense of their rights and responsibilities.\n\nSo after a bit of thinking and a bit of discussion, I came up with a trigger warning \u2014 I actually call it a \u201ccontent note\u201d \u2014 of my own, which I incorporated into my syllabus for the first time this summer.\n\nIn my content note I warn students that some of them may find some of the material we cover disturbing.\n\nI don\u2019t provide examples in the syllabus itself, but I do when we review it together. I let students know that I\u2019m open to discussing their personal reactions to historical topics during class or in my office hours, tell them that they\u2019re free to step outside briefly if they find any content overwhelming, and encourage them to talk to me privately if they have any specific concerns.\n\nA few weeks ago, after I settled on the language of my content note, I wrote a short essay on the subject for the online academic newspaper Inside Higher Ed.

Major schools recently disinvited graduation speakers whom activists deemed \u201cimproper\u201d to their notions of justice. And many institutions have begun formally to institute \u2014 or consider instituting \u2014 \"trigger warnings.\"\n\nTrigger warnings are verbal or written warnings instructors provide about material that might trigger \u201ctrauma\u201d in students who have experienced or witnessed traumatic events, including forms of assault and war, and are sensitive about such topics as race, gender, sexual orientation, colonialism and imperialism \u2014 to name a few.\n\nThe humane case for trigger warnings is that they allegedly help protect students from re-experiencing the past trauma, which can emotionally harm the student and interfere with his or her ability to learn.\n\nWhat could be wrong with that? Warnings might make outright censorship less likely, much like the movie industry avoided government censorship by agreeing to use ratings labels for films. This could even enhance freedom of inquiry while protecting emotional well-being. And have not many instructors quietly and informally engaged in such practice in the past?\n\nAlas, many substantial problems lurk just beneath the surface \u2014 especially when one considers the intellectual climate at many colleges and universities, of which the fate of recent graduation speakers is symptomatic. Let me touch on a few.\n\nFirst, as critics from across the political spectrum have averred, it is impossible to determine in advance what material merits a warning. To avoid complaints, threats and possible lawsuits because they failed to warn of some potentially offensive material, many instructors, given the general pressures at play in higher education, would likely extend warnings to large amounts of material, sending the misguided message that learning is traumatic per se.\n\nOr they could bowdlerize the course material in the name of sensitivity. If ever the concept of the slippery slope applied, it would apply here.\n\nAlready, trigger warnings have been applied to such works as \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d and other classics.\n\n\u201cGatsby?\u201d Really?! What\u2019s next? \u201cHamlet?\u201d And what if a student refuses to read the flagged material, however important it is to the class? Do not trigger warnings imply the right of refusal, which would open yet another Pandora\u2019s Box?\n\nAnother danger waits: formalizing trigger warnings would further empower the higher-ed sensitivity bureaucracies that are often as voracious and omnipresent as they are ignorant of basic academic freedom principles.\n\nMost important, the rationale for formal trigger warnings is inimical to the purposes of education.\n\nLiberal education should expose students to the depths of the human condition, which unavoidably entails matters of good and evil, life and death \u2014 what the German philosopher Nietzsche called \u201cuncomfortable truths.\u201d\n\nAnd civic education must prepare students to be mentally strong enough to handle the rigors associated with the clash of ideas that is paramount to a free society. As the great educational philosopher Alexander Meiklejohn remarked, \u201cTo be afraid of ideas, any idea, is to be unfit for self-government.\u201d\n\nBorn from the tenets of the controversial \u201ctrauma movement\u201d in psychology, trigger warnings assume that many students are not capable of handling the responsibilities of adult citizenship.\n\nIn the name of sensitivity, the movement undermines the very equal respect it ostensibly supports, while also fostering the mentality of in loco parentis that universities properly abandoned decades ago.\n\nTo deal with occasional cases of extreme material, leave the matter where it has always resided: at the considered informal discretion of instructors.\n\nIf a formal trigger warning must be had, place these words atop a university\u2019s main webpage: \u201cEducation necessarily exposes students to ideas and experiences that are new, challenging, and sometimes painful.

Unfortunately, many problems lie just beneath the surface.\n\nToo Many Trigger Warnings?\n\nFirst, it is impossible to determine in advance what deserves a warning. Complaints and court action are possible if professors don't warn of some potentially upsetting material. To avoid that, many teachers would likely warn about large amounts of material. They would do it just to be safe.\n\nOr they could cut parts of the course material to not upset anyone. Small cuts could lead to bigger ones.\n\nAlready, trigger warnings have been applied to famous works of literature. \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d and \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d are among them.\n\n\u201cGatsby?\u201d Really?! What\u2019s next? And what if a student refuses to read the flagged material, however important it is to the class?\n\nAnother danger: trigger warnings would give more power to the people who run colleges. Many are already too eager to add rules to protect students' feelings. They're more interested in that than the freedom to explore ideas in the classroom.\n\nThe Purpose Of Education\n\nMost important, trigger warnings are against the purpose of education.\n\nEducation should teach students about the good and bad that humans cause. Doing so must include matters of good and evil, life and death.\n\nAnd education must prepare students to be strong enough to handle clashing ideas. It is necessary to a free country. It is part of being a citizen. Trigger warnings treat students as if they are not ready to be citizens.\n\nAt the same time, the warnings put teachers in the place of parents.\n\nTo deal with upsetting material, leave the matter where it has always been left: to the judgment of professors.\n\nIf a trigger warning must be had, place these words atop a university\u2019s main webpage: \u201cEducation necessarily exposes students to ideas and experiences that are new, challenging, and sometimes painful. To be properly educated, you must learn to handle and welcome such challenges.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Donald A.

Photo: Dai Sugano/Bay Area News Group/MCT\nPRO: \"Trigger warnings\" won't interfere with learning\nNEW YORK \u2014 The college classroom is properly the site of serious discussion of potentially traumatic topics. \"Trigger warnings\" don\u2019t interfere with that process \u2014 in fact, they improve upon it.\n\nTrigger warnings\u2019 beginnings lie in the Internet. Originally, they arose as a way to alert readers about online content that might be traumatic.\n\nTheir premise is that a rape survivor, for instance, might legitimately prefer to have some warning before encountering a graphic description of sexual assault. Trigger warnings generally don\u2019t spark much hostility in online spaces. Some writers use them, but most don\u2019t.\n\nEarlier this year, though, college students started pushing for the use of trigger warnings in classes. Their demand provoked a massive and overwhelmingly negative response.\n\nAn Intriguing Idea\n\nUnlike most faculty, though, I found the idea intriguing. As a history professor I discuss some very difficult material in class, and I think it\u2019s important to give students a clear sense of their rights.\n\nSo I came up with a trigger warning of my own and incorporated it into my syllabus this summer.\n\nIn my trigger warning I warn students that some of them may find some of the material we cover disturbing.\n\nI let students know that I\u2019m open to discussing their personal reactions to historical topics during class or during my office hours, tell them that they\u2019re free to step outside briefly if they find any content overwhelming, and encourage them to talk to me privately if they have any specific concerns.\n\nA few weeks ago, I wrote a short essay on the subject for the online academic newspaper Inside Higher Ed and the response to it was starkly divided.\n\nMost of the opponents of trigger warnings who replied to my piece didn\u2019t find much to object to in my warning itself.\n\nInstead, they argued that what I\u2019d written wasn\u2019t a trigger warning at all \u2014 that it was too reasonable, too simple to fit that description.\n\nStill In Its Early Stages\n\nWith one mild exception, every trigger warning advocate who responded to my piece \u2014 in comments, on Facebook and Twitter, on blogs, or by email \u2014 embraced it.\n\nSeveral said that they would be adopting a version of it in their own syllabi or suggesting it to their professors. More than one said that it would have made a major difference in classes that they had found hostile to them.\n\nWhat does this tell us?\n\nThink at least three things: First, that the discussion of trigger warnings in the classroom is still in its early stages, and that faculty should take calls for change as invitations to dialogue rather than a threat.\n\nSecond, that despite the unfamiliar terminology, trigger warnings may not represent a huge departure from what we as professors are already doing.\n\nAnd third, that even minor adjustments to teaching practice can have a substantial positive impact on the classroom environment.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Angus Johnston teaches history at Hostos Community College in New York and maintains the website studentactivism.net.

Many universities have begun formally to institute \u2014 or consider instituting \u2014 \u201ctrigger warnings.\u201d\n\nTrigger warnings are verbal or written warnings. Instructors provide them about material that might trigger \u201ctrauma\u201d in students who have experienced or witnessed traumatic events, including forms of assault and war. Having such painful experiences may leave them sensitive to topics like race, gender, sexual preference, and the acts of countries ruling over others during colonialism and imperialism \u2014 to name a few.\n\nThe humane case for trigger warnings is that they allegedly help protect students from re-experiencing the past trauma, which can emotionally harm the student and interfere with his or her ability to learn.\n\nWhat could be wrong with that? Warnings might make outright censorship less likely, much like the movie industry avoided government censorship by agreeing to use ratings labels for films. This could even boost the freedom to explore ideas in classrooms while protecting emotional well-being.\n\nSending The Wrong Message\n\nAlas, many substantial problems lurk just beneath the surface. Let me touch on a few.\n\nFirst, as critics from a range of political views have asserted, it is impossible to determine in advance what material merits a warning. To avoid complaints, threats and possible lawsuits because they failed to warn of some potentially offensive material, many instructors would likely extend warnings to large amounts of material. Doing so would send the incorrect message that learning is traumatic in itself.\n\nOr they could censor the course material in the name of sensitivity. Small acts of censorship could lead to much larger ones.\n\nAlready, trigger warnings have been applied to such works as \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d and other classics.\n\n\u201cGatsby?\u201d Really?! What\u2019s next? And what if a student refuses to read the flagged material, however important it is to the class? Do not trigger warnings seem to allow students the right to refuse reading a text?\n\nAnother danger waits: formalizing trigger warnings would further empower the higher-ed administrators who are often as aggressive in enforcing sensitivity as they are ignorant of basic academic freedom principles.\n\nGood And Evil, Life And Death\n\nMost important, the reasoning behind formal trigger warnings is contrary to the purposes of education.\n\nEducation should expose students to the depths of the human condition, which unavoidably involves matters of good and evil, life and death \u2014 what the German philosopher Nietzsche called \u201cuncomfortable truths.\u201d\n\nAnd education must prepare students to be mentally strong enough to handle the clash of ideas that is part of a free society. As the great educational philosopher Alexander Meiklejohn remarked, \u201cTo be afraid of ideas, any idea, is to be unfit for self-government.\u201d\n\nTrigger warnings assume that many students are not capable of handling the responsibilities of adult citizenship. At the same time, they also foster the mentality of acting in the place of parents. Universities properly abandoned this idea decades ago.\n\nTo deal with occasional cases of extreme material, leave the matter where it has always resided: to the judgment of instructors.\n\nIf a formal trigger warning must be had, place these words atop a university\u2019s main webpage: \u201cEducation necessarily exposes students to ideas and experiences that are new, challenging, and sometimes painful. To be properly educated, you must learn to handle and welcome such challenges.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Donald A.

It was owned by a private company and meant to hold the most dangerous children.\n\nThese children arrived at the Southwest Indiana Regional Youth Village. Some were picked out at the border because of tattoos that hinted they might be gang members. Others were stopped on suspicion of drug use and other offenses in their home countries. Some had caused trouble or run away from less guarded centers in the United States. A few had U.S. police records.\n\nAs the director of the Immigration Clinic of Indiana University's school of law, I traveled to Vincennes with volunteer law school students to provide legal help to these kids.\n\nChildren Fleeing Violence\n\nThe federal government helped pay for the Immigration Clinic students and me to give \"Know Your Rights\" presentations to the children. We explained to them their legal rights and what they could expect in immigration court.\n\nChildren \u2014 like adults \u2014 have no legal right to have the government pay for their lawyers in immigration court. As a result, we interviewed the children to match strong cases with volunteer lawyers.\n\nWe found children fleeing domestic abuse, gang violence and drugs. Some were sexually abused and mistreated in other U.S. holding centers.\n\nThese children qualified for U.S. government protection or special visas. The visas grant them permission to stay in the U.S. They are set aside for abandoned children. Other visas are for people who have been the victims of crime or who were taken from their homes and forced to work. Many were reunited with family in the United States. Others went home voluntarily. Some were sent home.\n\nRiot Gear And Billy Clubs\n\nAt one point, the immigrant children in Vincennes staged a peaceful protest against the conditions at the center. The local SWAT team was called in with riot gear, billy clubs and a police dog. Children were placed in lockdown, solitary confinement and other abuse.\n\nWhen they told my law school students of their bad treatment, we notified the federal government, which took immediate action. Soon after, the private holding center stopped housing immigrant children.\n\nThe federal treatment of today's immigrant children is like what happened at Vincennes, although on a much larger scale.\n\nThe violence in Central America is increasing because people here in the U.S. keep buying illegal drugs and guns that come from there. Children are gathering along the border. Volunteer lawyers are being sent to these sites to deliver \"Know Your Rights\" presentations and interview children. Lawyers are representing children reunited with families throughout the country.\n\nU.S. immigration and refugee law protects victims of violence and persecution. Lawyers, law schools and other volunteers are now stepping up to work with the federal government.\n\nMigrant Or Refugee?\n\nCertainly, it is not a perfect system. But President Obama and White House officials are committed to protecting the children within today's political and legal limits.\n\nPart of that effort includes deciding whether children in Honduras deserve to be considered refugees. People who fear for their lives throughout the world have the right to seek refuge, or safety, from the U.S. as part of the Refugee Act of 1980.\n\nThese laws are based on the U.S.'s history of protecting people fleeing danger and agreements passed after World War II.\n\nNot every child should be allowed to stay. But turning children away at gunpoint goes against laws and our history. Our youngest immigrants must continue to have their legal rights protected. Those who qualify should be given visas to stay. Those who don't should be sent back home safely as necessary.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Linda Kelly is the M.

It's been caused, in part, by his administration's mismanagement.\n\nCongress returns next month from summer break. Until then, he should use the tools he has to secure the border and to discourage unlawful crossings. He should not take actions on his own that might make matters worse.\n\nThe president has been trying to walk a fine line. He wants to keep Latino leaders who support him happy. At the same time, he wants to convince Central Americans not to start the perilous journey north. Although compassionate talk about immigrants is good politics, it is not a good way to address the problem.\n\nThe crisis has been made worse by talk in Washington about a possible \"amnesty\" of illegal immigrants that would allow them all to stay here. In 2012, Obama decided to stop deporting youth with close ties to the United States. It got people first talking about an amnesty. Then news spread that young children arriving at the border were being released until their hearings, which only increased the amnesty rumors.\n\nThe \"Push Factor\"\n\nLast month, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez blamed unclear U.S. border enforcement. He said it can \"pull\" people to rush across the U.S. border.\n\nHernandez also explained the \"push factor\" causing people to leave: drug violence and deadly street gangs preying on youth in his country and neighboring El Salvador and Guatemala. Unfortunately, these are poor nations with governments unable or unwilling to deal with these challenges.\n\nSupporters of refugees say that over half of those arriving recently have real claims that by law require a hearing.\n\nA survey in May by the Border Patrol found something different. Nearly all of the immigrants they interviewed made the trek because of rumors of weak border patrols. According to sources in Central America, so-called \"coyotes\" \u2014 criminals who make their living smuggling people \u2014 promise that the U.S. border is weakly guarded. It brings in more business for them.\n\nScreen For True Refugees\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. passed a law aimed at stopping human trafficking. Traffickers move people illegally from their homes, often to other countries, and force them to work. Part of how Obama handled the border crisis badly was to overuse the law. It requires a complicated hearing to determine if an immigrant qualifies for special protection.\n\nThe current crisis is fueled primarily by smuggling, not trafficking. Border guards should be allowed to use their experience and judgment. Let them screen for true refugee or trafficking cases.\n\nOf course, real refugees in U.S. territory must be treated lawfully. However, the United Nations should work with local governments to offer relief to refugees in their own countries. It shouldn't wait for them to run all the way to the U.S. border.\n\nOne thing we all can agree upon is that no one should risk the thousand-mile trek through Mexico. Many migrants are abused, robbed, raped or killed along the journey.\n\nIrresponsible And Dangerous\n\nIf the appearance of weak border patrol lures people to risk their lives that must change immediately. Republicans made these arguments while crafting a tough proposal. It would strengthen border enforcement, make it easier to deport new arrivals and send a clear signal that the border is being secured.\n\nThe president at first talked tough on border enforcement. It seems though that his political advisers recommended that he let congressional Republicans deal with it.\n\nHowever, securing the border is the responsibility of the president, not the job of Congress. And, the president does not need new authority to get a handle on this crisis. He must state firmly that illegal crossings will be stopped, most new arrivals will be turned around, and an \"amnesty\" is off the table.\n\nSeeking to win votes for Democrats by blaming Republicans for inaction on the border is irresponsible and dangerous. It will only make the current crisis last longer. It also hurts any agreement between Democrats and Republicans. They'll need to work together to end the current crisis and to eventually fix an immigration system that is failing the country.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Roger F.

Others had caused trouble or run away from less secure facilities in the United States. A few had U.S. juvenile delinquency records.\n\nAs the Immigration Clinic Director of Indiana University's McKinney School of Law, I traveled to Vincennes with volunteer law school students to provide legal assistance to these kids.\n\nFunded in part by the federal government, the Immigration Clinic students and I provided \"Know Your Rights\" presentations to explain to the children their legal rights and what they could expect in upcoming immigration court proceedings.\n\nChildren \u2014 like adults \u2014 have no legal right to government-funded attorneys in immigration proceedings. As a result, we individually interviewed the children to match strong cases with volunteer attorneys.\n\nWe found children fleeing domestic abuse, gang violence and drugs. Some were subject to rape and mistreatment in other U.S. detention facilities.\n\nThese children were eligible for asylum and other special visas for abandoned children and victims of crime and human trafficking. Many were reunited with family in the United States based on the Supreme Court guarantee of \"least restrictive placement\" for children in immigration proceedings. Others went home voluntarily. Some were deported.\n\nAt one point, the immigrant children in Vincennes staged a peaceful sit-down to protest detention conditions. The local Knox County SWAT team was called in with riot gear, billy clubs and a police dog. Children were subject to lockdown, solitary confinement and other abuse.\n\nWhen they confided the facility's misconduct to IU's law school students, we notified the federal government, which took immediate corrective action. Shortly thereafter, the private facility stopped housing immigrant children.\n\nThe federal treatment of today's immigrant children mirrors what happened at Vincennes, although on a much larger scale.\n\nAs the U.S. demand for drugs and guns continues, the violence in Central America is increasing. Children are amassing along the border. Volunteer attorneys are being recruited to travel to these sites to deliver \"Know Your Rights\" presentations and individually screen children. Pro bono and privately paid attorneys are assuming the representation of children reunited with families throughout the country.\n\nU.S. immigration and refugee law protects survivors of violence and persecution. Attorneys, law school clinics and other volunteers are now stepping up and coordinating their services with the federal government.\n\nCertainly, it is not a perfect system. But the Obama administration continues to demonstrate a commitment to protecting undocumented children within today's political and legal limits.\n\nInitial exploration of refugee status for children in Honduras is part of that effort. Individuals fearing persecution throughout the world have had the right to seek refugee status at U.S. embassies following the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980.\n\nThis humanitarian legislation also gives the resident discretionary authority to address \"unforeseen emergency refugee situations.\" These laws are built upon our historical protection of persons and acceptance of international conventions passed in the wake of World War II.\n\nNot every child is entitled to admission. But turning children away at gunpoint is inconsistent with established law and practice. Our youngest immigrants must continue to have their legal rights protected, provided visas when merited, and repatriated safely as necessary.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Linda Kelly is the M.

One can only hope that he will not take unilateral actions that might make matters worse.\n\nThe president has been trying to walk a fine line between accommodating leaders of his domestic Latino base while at the same time dissuading Central Americans from starting the perilous journey north. Although compassionate rhetoric about immigrants is good politics, it is not good policy.\n\nAfter all, the current crisis has been stoked by loose talk in Washington about a possible \"amnesty\" of illegal immigrants, stoked by Obama's 2012 decision to suspend deportation of youth with long-standing ties to the United States, and news that young children arriving at the border were being released pending hearings.\n\nDuring a visit to Washington last month, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez cited \"ambiguities\" about U.S. border enforcement that are part of the \"pull factor\" encouraging people to rush across the U.S. border.\n\nHernandez also explained the \"push factor\": narco-violence that sows insecurity and deadly street gangs preying on youth in his country and neighboring El Salvador and Guatemala. Unfortunately, these are poor nations with governments unable or unwilling to deal with these challenges.\n\nRefugee advocates contend that more than half of those arriving in recent months have bona fide claims that require a hearing under U.S. and international law.\n\nThat is contradicted by a Border Patrol survey in May that found that nearly all of those interviewed made the trek because of recent rumors of leniency. According to sources in Central America, so-called \"coyotes\" \u2014 criminals who make their living smuggling people \u2014 have been advertising lax U.S. border enforcement to drum up business.\n\nPart of the initial problem in responding to the border crisis was the administration's overly broad application of a 2008 anti-human-trafficking law that requires a complicated hearing on an immigrant's asylum pleas.\n\nThe current crisis is fueled primarily by smuggling, not trafficking. Border personnel should be allowed to use their experience and discretion to screen for legitimate refugee or trafficking cases.\n\nOf course, bona fide refugees in U.S. territory must be attended to lawfully. However, the UN should work with local governments to offer relief to refugees in their country of origin, rather than wait for them to run the gauntlet to the U.S. border.\n\nOne thing that all can agree upon is that no one is better off risking the thousand-mile trek through Mexico, during which many migrants are abused, robbed, raped or killed.\n\nIf the perception of lax enforcement lures people to risk life and limb that must change immediately. Republicans made these arguments while crafting a tough measure that would strengthen border enforcement, make it easier to deport new arrivals and send an unambiguous signal that the border is being secured.\n\nAlthough the president initially talked tough on border enforcement, his political advisers apparently recommended that he toss the \"hot potato\" to congressional Republicans.\n\nHowever, securing the border is the responsibility of the president, not the Congress. And, the president does not need new authority to get a handle on this crisis by sending an unambiguous message that illegal crossings will be stopped, most new arrivals will be turned around, and a sweeping unilateral \"amnesty\" is off the table.\n\nSeeking a domestic political \"win\" by blaming congressional Republicans for inaction on the border is extraordinarily irresponsible \u2014 even dangerous.\n\nNot only does it prolong the current crisis, it undermines the kind of bipartisan consensus that will be required to pay the costs of the current crisis and to eventually overhaul an immigration system that is failing the country.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Roger F.

Now, more and more of them are children. Violence in Central America is growing worse. Children are gathering along the border to get away.\n\nIndiana is a long way from the Mexican border. Many children from Central America caught at the border were sent to Indiana by the government. They ended up in immigration holding centers and were treated badly.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2010, the federal government hired a youth jail center in Vincennes, Indiana, called the Southwest Indiana Regional Youth Village to hold immigrant children. It was supposed to house the most dangerous children.\n\nThese children arrived at the Southwest Indiana Regional Youth Village. Police at the border had spotted tattoos on some of them that made them seem like gang members. Others were stopped because of crimes in their home countries. Some had caused trouble or run away from other housing centers in the United States. A few had U.S. police records.\n\nTheir Legal Rights\n\nI run the Immigration Clinic of Indiana University's law school. I traveled to Vincennes with volunteer law school students. We went to help these kids.\n\nThe U.S. government helped pay for my law students and me to meet with the children. We explained their legal rights to them. We let them know what they could expect in immigration court. We found lawyers willing to work for free for some of them.\n\nThe children told us stories of fleeing abuse at home, gangs and drugs. Some were mistreated in other U.S. immigrant centers.\n\nMany were reunited with family in the United States. Others decided to go home. Some were sent home.\n\nAt one point, the immigrant children in Vincennes peacefully protested against their conditions. The response was harsh. Police arrived with billy clubs and a police dog. Children were not allowed out of their rooms. Some were put in rooms by themselves and allowed no human contact.\n\nWhen they told my law school students of their bad treatment, we reported it.

President Obama is partly to blame. He has handled the situation badly. His actions even encourage people to make the dangerous and illegal crossing into the U.S.\n\nObama must secure the border and stop illegal crossings.\n\nThe president is trying to do too much. He wants to keep Latino leaders happy because he needs their support. At the same time, he wants to convince Central Americans not to start the dangerous trip north.\n\nObama made things worse with his actions. He made people think immigrants here illegally might be allowed to stay here. In 2012, Obama decided to stop sending children back to their home countries if they had already spent years in the U.S. Then news spread that young children arriving at the border were being released until their court hearings. It started rumors that the U.S. was allowing people to stay.\n\nWeakly Guarded Border?\n\nHonduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez blames the problem on confusion about U.S. border rules. The Central American leader said this confusion \"pulls\" people to cross the U.S. border.\n\nHernandez also said drug violence and gangs \"push\" people to leave their countries. El Salvador and Guatemala face the same problems. Unfortunately, these are poor nations. Their governments cannot handle these challenges.\n\nSupporters of refugees say that most people crossing the border have good reasons.\n\nA survey in May by the Border Patrol found something different.

Nowadays, more and more of them are children from Central America. Many of them have been winding up in Indiana.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2010, the federal government hired a youth jail center in Vincennes, Indiana, to hold immigrant children. It was supposed to house the most dangerous children.\n\nThese children arrived at the Southwest Indiana Regional Youth Village. Some were picked out at the border because of tattoos that made them seem like gang members. Others were stopped because they seemed to be on drugs or had committed crimes in their home countries. Some had caused trouble or run away from immigrant housing in the United States. A few had U.S. police records.\n\nI run the Immigration Clinic of Indiana University's law school. I went to Vincennes with volunteer law school students. We went to provide legal help to these kids.\n\nHarsh Treatment At One Center\n\nThe U.S. government helped pay for my law students and me to meet with the children. We explained to them their legal rights and what they could expect in immigration court.\n\nThe government doesn't give children or adults the right to free lawyers in immigration court. As a result, we interviewed the children to match some with lawyers willing to work for free.\n\nWe found children fleeing abuse at home, gang violence and drugs. Some were mistreated in other U.S. holding centers.\n\nThese children were qualified to stay in the U.S. because they were abandoned or victims of crime. Some had been taken from their homes and forced to work. Many were reunited with family in the United States, while others went home voluntarily. Some were sent home.\n\nAt one point, the immigrant children in Vincennes protested peacefully against the conditions at the holding centers. The police were called in with riot gear, clubs and a police dog. Children were confined to their rooms, not allowed contact with others, and given other harsh treatment.\n\nWhen they told my law school students of their bad treatment, we notified the U.S. government. It took immediate action. Soon after, the private holding center stopped housing immigrant children.\n\nProtecting Victims Of Violence\n\nOur government's treatment of immigrant children is like what happened at Vincennes \u2014 it's just happening in a much larger way.\n\nAs the violence in Central America increases, children are gathering along the border to escape.\n\nU.S. immigration and refugee law protects victims of violence. Certainly, it is not a perfect system. But Obama and White House officials are dedicated to protecting immigrant children within today's political and legal limits.\n\nPeople afraid of being hurt can ask for protection in the U.S. It doesn't matter what country they come from. Our laws allow them the right to ask to stay here and be protected as refugees.\n\nNot every child should be allowed to stay. But turning children away at gunpoint goes against our laws and our history.

His poor handling of the situation encourages people to make the dangerous and illegal crossing into the U.S.\n\nObama should try to secure the border and discourage illegal crossings.\n\nThe president has been trying to please everyone. He wants to keep Latino leaders happy because he needs their votes and support. At the same time, he wants to convince Central Americans not to start the dangerous journey north.\n\nThe crisis has been made worse by talk in Washington that immigrants here illegally would be allowed to stay here. The talk started in 2012 when Obama decided to stop deporting youth with close ties to the United States. Then news spread that young children arriving at the border were being released until their hearings. It increased the rumors that immigrants would be allowed to stay.\n\n\"Pull\" And \"Push\"\n\nLast month, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez blamed unclear U.S. immigration rules. The Central American leader said it can \"pull\" people to rush across the U.S. border.\n\nHernandez also explained what may \"push\" people to leave their countries: drug violence and deadly street gangs. Neighboring El Salvador and Guatemala face the same problems. Unfortunately, these are poor nations. Their governments are unable to deal with these challenges.\n\nSupporters of immigrants say that more than half of those arriving recently may qualify for special permission to stay here. Such permission is granted to refugees, or people who are forced to leave their country because of disaster or violence. The supporters say the law requires the immigrants be allowed to plead their case in court.\n\nA May survey by the Border Patrol found something different. Nearly all of the immigrants they interviewed made the trek because of rumors of weak border patrols. According to sources in Central America, so-called \"coyotes\" \u2014 criminals who make their living smuggling people \u2014 promise that the U.S. border is easy to cross. It brings in more business for them.\n\nPart of how Obama handled the border crisis badly was to overuse a 2008 law that requires a complicated hearing if an immigrant asks for protection in the U.S. The law was designed to protect people who were being moved across the border by others. Usually, it was to force them to work in bad conditions for little or no money.\n\nA Stronger Border Needed\n\nThe current crisis is not about such people. It's about people who have decided to come on their own. Border guards should be allowed to use their judgment. Let them pick out the people who are truly refugees or victims of crime.\n\nOf course, refugees must be protected. However, the United Nations should work with local governments to offer relief to refugees in their own country. It shouldn't wait for them to run all the way to the U.S. border.\n\nOne thing we all can agree upon is that no one should risk the thousand-mile journey through Mexico. Many migrants are abused, robbed, or killed along the way.\n\nThe appearance of a weak border persuades people to risk their lives. We must change that immediately.\n\nSecuring the border is Obama's job, but he wants to blame Congress. It's not the job of Congress. Obama must say strongly that illegal crossings will be stopped. He must declare that most new arrivals will be turned around. He must end the rumors that people who are already here without permission will be allowed to stay.\n\nBlaming Congress only makes things worse. We all need to work together to end the crisis and fix an immigration system that is failing the country.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Roger F.

It was meant to hold the children considered the most dangerous.\n\nThese children arrived at the Southwest Indiana Regional Youth Village after being identified at the border because of tattoos or suspicion of drug use and other offenses in their home countries. Others had caused trouble or run away from less secure holding centers in the United States. A few had U.S. police records.\n\nAs the director of the Immigration Clinic of Indiana University's school of law, I traveled to Vincennes with volunteer law school students. We went to provide legal assistance to these kids.\n\n\"Know Your Rights\"\n\nThe federal government helped pay for the Immigration Clinic students and me to give \"Know Your Rights\" presentations to the children. We explained to them their legal rights and what they could expect once they went to immigration court.\n\nChildren \u2014 like adults \u2014 have no legal right to government-provided attorneys in immigration proceedings. As a result, we interviewed the children to match strong cases with volunteer attorneys.\n\nWe found children fleeing domestic abuse, gang violence and drugs. Some were raped and mistreated in other U.S. holding centers.\n\nThese children were eligible for U.S. government protection in the form of asylum and other special visas. The visas, which grant them permission to stay in the U.S., are for abandoned children and victims of crime and human trafficking. Many children have been trafficked from their homes to other places and forced to work. Many were reunited with family in the United States. Others went home voluntarily. Some were deported.\n\nSWAT Team At Protest\n\nAt one point, the immigrant children in Vincennes staged a peaceful sit-down to protest the conditions in which they were held. The local Knox County SWAT team was called in with riot gear, billy clubs and a police dog. Children were subject to lockdown, solitary confinement and other abuse.\n\nWhen they told IU's law school students of the holding center's bad treatment, we notified the federal government, which took immediate action. Shortly thereafter, the privately owned center stopped housing immigrant children.\n\nThe federal treatment of today's immigrant children is like what happened at Vincennes, although on a much larger scale.\n\nThe violence in Central America is increasing because the U.S. keeps buying illegal drugs and guns from there. Children are gathering along the border. Volunteer attorneys are being recruited to travel to these sites to deliver \"Know Your Rights\" presentations and individually screen children. Privately paid attorneys and those offering their services for free are representing children reunited with families throughout the country.\n\nU.S. immigration and refugee law protects survivors of violence and persecution. Attorneys, law school students and other volunteers are now stepping up and coordinating their services with the federal government.\n\nProtecting The Children\n\nCertainly, it is not a perfect system. But the Obama administration continues to demonstrate a commitment to protecting undocumented children within today's political and legal limits.\n\nPart of that effort includes figuring out whether children in Honduras should count as refugees. Individuals fearing persecution throughout the world have had the right to seek refugee status at U.S. embassies because of the Refugee Act of 1980.\n\nThese laws are built upon our historical protection of persons and acceptance of international agreements passed in the wake of World War II.\n\nNot every child should be allowed to stay. But turning children away at gunpoint does not match with law and practice. Our youngest immigrants must continue to have their legal rights protected, provided visas when justified, and sent back home safely as necessary.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Linda Kelly is the M.

It's been caused, in part, by his administration's mismanagement.\n\nUntil Congress returns next month, he should use the tools he has to secure the border and to discourage illegal crossings. One can only hope that he will not take actions on his own that might make matters worse.\n\nThe president has been trying to walk a fine line. He wants to keep Latino leaders who support him happy, while at the same time convincing Central Americans not to start the perilous journey north. Although compassionate talk about immigrants is good politics, it is not good policy.\n\nAfter all, the current crisis has been stoked by loose talk in Washington about a possible \"amnesty\" of illegal immigrants. Obama's 2012 decision to suspend deportation of youth with long-standing ties to the United States got people first talking about an amnesty that would pardon immigrants who crossed illegally. News that young children arriving at the border were being released until their hearings only increased the chatter.\n\nA Rush Across The Border\n\nDuring a visit to Washington last month, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez blamed the unclear understanding of U.S. border enforcement for helping encourage people to rush across the U.S. border. It is part of what he calls the \"pull factor.\"\n\nHernandez also explained the push factor: drug violence that creates insecurity and deadly street gangs preying on youth in his country and neighboring El Salvador and Guatemala. Unfortunately, these are poor nations with governments unable or unwilling to deal with these challenges.\n\nImmigrant supporters assert that more than half of those arriving recently have legitimate claims that require a hearing under U.S. and international law to determine if they qualify as refugees.\n\nThat is contradicted by a Border Patrol survey in May that found that nearly all of those interviewed made the trek because of recent rumors of weak border enforcement. According to sources in Central America, so-called \"coyotes\" \u2014 criminals who make their living smuggling people \u2014 have been advertising weak U.S. border enforcement to drum up business.\n\nCrisis Fueled By Smuggling\n\nIn 2008, a law was passed to prevent human trafficking, a crime in which people are taken from their homes and forced to work elsewhere, usually in another country. Part of the initial problem in responding to the border crisis was the Obama administration's too broad use of that law. It requires a complicated hearing to determine if an immigrant should receive protection in the form of asylum, which allows them to stay in the U.S.\n\nThe current crisis is fueled primarily by smuggling, not trafficking. Border guards should be allowed to use their experience and judgment to screen for authentic refugee or trafficking cases.\n\nOf course, real refugees in U.S. territory must be treated lawfully. However, the United Nations should work with local governments to offer relief to refugees in their country of origin. It shouldn't wait for them to run all the way to the U.S. border.\n\nOne thing that all can agree upon is that no one is better off risking the thousand-mile trek through Mexico. Many migrants are abused, robbed, raped or killed along the journey.\n\nIf the appearance of weak enforcement lures people to risk life and limb that must change immediately. Republicans made these arguments while crafting a tough measure. It would strengthen border enforcement, make it easier to deport new arrivals and send a clear signal that the border is being secured.\n\nSecuring The Border\n\nAlthough the president initially talked tough on border enforcement, his political advisers apparently recommended that he toss the \"hot potato\" to congressional Republicans.\n\nHowever, securing the border is the responsibility of the president, not the Congress. And, the president does not need new authority to get a handle on this crisis. He can gain control of it by stating firmly that illegal crossings will be stopped, most new arrivals will be turned around, and that \"amnesty-for-all\" is off the table.\n\nSeeking a domestic political \"win\" by blaming congressional Republicans for inaction on the border is extraordinarily irresponsible \u2014 even dangerous.\n\nNot only does it prolong the current crisis, it undermines any agreements between Democrats and Republicans. They'll need to work together to pay the costs of the current crisis and to eventually rebuild an immigration system that is failing the country.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Roger F.

Photo: AP Photo/Paul Sancya\nPRO: World cup started great conversations\nVIENNA, Va. \u2014 Although in the past Americans have ignored soccer, this year's World Cup soccer has been a hot topic of conversation in the United States.\n\nGames involving Team USA had as many viewers as the NBA finals. They had even more than baseball's World Series. \"Watch Parties\" drew tens of thousands of people nationwide.\n\nThis time around, America embraced the \"beautiful game.\" We were gripped by the stunning goals and puzzling offsides, joyous patriotism and fake dives and flops. Our new love of soccer was due to several reasons:\n\nConvenient starting times: First-round group games from Brazil began at noon, with another contest to follow. The final match was on in the early evening on the East Coast. Matches became a great reason to leave work early.\n\nThese Got Our Attention Too\n\nShort matches: The games take 2 1/2 hours to play. Less than three hours to watch a sporting event? It makes you realize what time wasters baseball, football and basketball are with their commercial breaks and nonstop timeouts.\n\nShaky goaltenders: Few keepers could save a game for their team by themselves. Any shot became a good shot in Brazil. That's quite different from hockey's Stanley Cup playoffs, for example. Sometimes you wonder if anybody is going to score in the Stanley Cup.\n\nUpsets galore: After the dust settled in Week One, reigning champion Spain and always powerful England had already been knocked out. That left the door open for such countries as Colombia, Costa Rica, Algeria and Chile to show their stuff.\n\n\"USA, USA:\" America was placed in the same division with such heavyweights as Germany, Ghana and Portugal. Even so, the U.S. made it out of the first round. The team took Belgium to overtime before being bounced out in the next round.\n\nTeam USA Rocked!\n\nTo his credit, American coach Jurgen Klinsmann urged his team to fight it out with the traditional soccer powers. He didn't want them to just defend. Thanks to scoring from their stars like Clint Dempsey, that often happened. That's much different from American teams in past World Cups.\n\nTeam USA may be out of this year's tournament, but it didn't go quietly. That could make all the difference in the years ahead.\n\nFor years, kids in this country, as in the rest of the world, have grown up playing soccer.\n\nUntil now, that's where it ended. Once kids stopped playing the game, they watched football, baseball and basketball like everyone else.\n\nYet this time around, more Americans checked out the World Cup than ever before and they liked what they saw. Once you give the beautiful game a long look it's difficult to turn away. It's especially hard when you're cheering a team that refuses to back down.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER Tim Wendel is the writer-in-residence at Johns Hopkins University and the author of 11 books, including \"Summer of '68\" and \"Castro's Curveball.\"\n\nThis essay is available to McClatchy-Tribune News Service subscribers.

This is fun?\nWASHINGTON - Soccer is easy to make fun of. In what other sport can we put together a scorecard of the number of fake \u201cinjuries\u201d? Or the time the supposedly injured players spent squirming on the ground?\n\nHow about when \u201cinjured\u201d players are regularly carried off on stretchers and then return to the game seconds later? When\u2019s the last time you saw that in any American sport?\n\nI am not here to make fun of soccer. I\u2019ve tried to like it.\n\nLet me set the stage. It is the summer of 1994 and I am a student living in London. Each summer, the campus housing where I lived had some visiting Italian students who nicely insisted that I watch the World Cup with them.\n\nIn The Name Of Sportsmanship, We Watched\n\nI did so, game in and game out. And, to the joy of my newfound friends, Italy progressed all the way to the final against mighty Brazil.\n\nSo we watched what I was told would be sports at its best. For 90 minutes we watched and no one scored. We watched through extra time. Still, no one scored.\n\nAt last, the game was settled through a shootout where players kick at the goal. The goalie must guess at which side of the goal the player will kick the ball. He only has enough time to dive in one direction.\n\nDuring the game, Italy\u2019s goalie guessed wrong and Brazil walked off the World Cup champions. A coin flip would have been pretty much the same.\n\nThis helps explain why soccer may be the world\u2019s sport, but not yet America\u2019s. I'm not against anyone's love of soccer. I'll admit that baseball is pretty dull.\n\nWhere Is Soccer's Craftiness?\n\nSoccer is a fine game. However, American football and basketball are a battle, based on craftiness, drive and the repeated attack on the other team's weaknesses.\n\nA football or basketball coach searches for gaps in the opposing team\u2019s strategy - or plan. He'll look for when players aren't matched up equally. When he finds a weakness, the coach will take advantage of it again and again. And his team will score points as a result.\n\nAnd an error by coaches or a major playing mistake by athletes on the field will almost always cost that team on the scoreboard.\n\nSure, a basketball or American football game can be decided by a lucky play or a bad call, if it\u2019s very close. But in the most popular U.S. sports it's easier to score. High scores make it very unlikely that the better team will lose the game. This isn't true in soccer. It is filled with fine plays that go unrewarded and terrible mistakes that go unpunished.\n\nAt the end of the day, sports are entertainment.\n\nIf millions of people like watching a bunch of men kick a ball around for 90-plus minutes for it to end in a scoreless tie, then that\u2019s OK by me.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER Andrew G.

At a recent black-tie dinner, he stood \u2014 stoop-shouldered and peering commandingly over his signature thick, black-frame glasses \u2014 and remarked: \u201cUnilateral withdrawal is not victory.\u201d\n\nHe was referring to the Obama administration's ill-considered decision to pull our military out of Afghanistan.\n\nKissinger knows a thing or two about the pain of walking away. After negotiating the Paris Peace Treaty to end the Vietnam War, he saw President Nixon resign in disgrace over the Watergate scandal, then watched Congress pull the plug on all support for South Vietnam.\n\nAmerica\u2019s 25-year effort in Vietnam was wasted with our early pullout. With backing from the our Cold War enemy, the communist Soviet Union, the North Vietnamese rolled over the South, and the country became communist. Vietnam, and neighbors Laos and Cambodia, experienced a bloodbath of brutality and genocide under communist regimes. The Soviet Union, which consisted of several Eastern European countries, and controlled by Russia, was strengthened. It bankrolled new revolutions in South America and Africa and fostered a wave of Islamist terrorism across the Middle East.\n\nThough many Vietnam War protesters, including now Secretary of State John Kerry, trumpet America\u2019s withdrawal as a triumph, there is no reason to be proud of how we left. While we can still debate the wisdom of going to war there, there is no doubt that our total abandonment of our allies left bloody and shameful consequences.\n\nKissinger\u2019s comments weren\u2019t meant to recall ancient history. He was lamenting history repeating itself, and the prospects of that are now high as Afghanistan could fail ... needlessly.\n\nPlucking Defeat From Victory\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s Afghan strategy is nearly identical to its withdrawal from Iraq. It assumes that once the immediate threat of the collapse of the regime has passed, it\u2019s OK to head for the exit. But absence of looming failure is a poor standard for declaring victory \u2014 no better than when George W. Bush gave an unfortunate high-five under the \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner after the initial invasion of Iraq.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that the United States should plan major, unending commitments to a country after a fight. But once the levels of violence have come down, some further commitment is usually necessary to help peace take root.\n\nIraq is a case study in how to withdraw from a war in the wrong way. It is absurd to argue that the White House could not have gotten permission to retain a small force there \u2014 it simply didn\u2019t want to. It is also clear that the U.S. pullout left a vacuum of power that was eagerly filled by al-Qaida as it regained its strength. Today, Iraq suffers much higher levels of violence than when Obama took office.\n\nThe prospects for a withdrawal from Afghanistan are even grimmer. Obama\u2019s Afghan \u201csurge\u201d of sending tens of thousands of troops to deal a death blow to al-Qaida was not nearly as massive and effective as the Bush surge in Iraq. The Taliban still have sanctuaries in Pakistan that allow them to operate freely. The Haqqani Network of Islamic fighters is as robust as ever and al-Qaida is waiting in the wings to attack. The drug trade that funds the rebels remains robust as well. These are daunting challenges for the Afghan people to handle on their own.\n\nWhile Obama talks of finishing the job in Afghanistan, many in the administration would be delighted to go with the \u201czero\u201d option \u2014 no U.S. troops, period. But it\u2019s not clear that a small multinational presence will be enough to hold the hard-won gains there.\n\nThe U.S. went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan to eliminate the terrorist forces that had killed thousands of Americans and threatened to kill many, many more. Job 1 was not to bring freedom and justice to those lands, but America always prefers to leave a path to liberty and prosperity in the wake of its wars.\n\nSadly in the case of Afghanistan, Obama seems once again poised to pluck defeat from the jaws of victory, as he did in Iraq. Future administrations will reap the blowback from the chaos our withdrawal will bring and they'll have to deal with it \u2014 probably at greater cost. \u201cUnilateral withdrawal is not victory.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: James Jay Carafano is vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nThis essay is available to McClatchy-Tribune News Service subscribers.

It is a lesson with huge immediate implications, because in recent days we are hearing new rumblings about a possible U.S. military intervention in Syria's civil war.\n\nIn Iraq, President George W. Bush apparently gave little thought to what might replace the government of then leader Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn 1991, when his father, President George H.W. Bush, attacked Iraq over its occupation of Kuwait, he was urged by some in Congress to expand the operation to attack the capital city, Baghdad, and remove Saddam Hussein from power.\n\nWisely, he knew that such action would open a can of worms. Under Saddam Hussein, power rested in the hands of the Sunni community, a minority within Iraq that worships one brand of Islam. The majority Shiite community practices a somewhat different type of Islam and was resentful over its treatment at the hands of Saddam Hussein. Removal of Saddam Hussein would upset the existing order, Bush senior realized.\n\nWhat was not difficult to see when his son ordered the invasion of Iraq was the likelihood that any new government there would be dominated by the majority Shiite community. It was clear that the Shiite community might seek justice for its suffering in a way that would leave the country in chaos.\n\nSo when we see current Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki tilting toward the Shiites, that is the result of the situation we set up with our invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nThe Sunni in Iraq are reacting now with violence. Whether we are there with troops or not, that difficult relationship between Sunni and Shiite is playing itself out with violence breaking out between the two groups daily.\n\nNor was it difficult to guess that a Shiite-led government in Iraq would be on good terms with the government of Iran, given that Iran has a Shiite government as well. Since the Iranian Revolution in 1979, we have been at constant odds with Iran's leaders. So by invading Iraq, we were boosting support in the region for the government of Iran.\n\nLiving With Political Realities\n\nIn Afghanistan, we removed a government headed by the Taliban, an extreme religious party. Afghanistan, as was known at the time, houses a variety of ethnic groups who have never in their history come all together to form political order across the country.\n\nNow the warlords who ruled small fiefdoms in Afghanistan are making a comeback. One of them may wind up as the next president in elections to be held soon. We are having trouble convincing Hamid Karzai, the current president, to let our troops remain in some numbers past the end of 2014. We want to keep Afghan courts from having legal authority over any offenses that may be committed in the future by the U.S. military there. Karzai rejects this demand.\n\nIn both instances, our military invasions \u2014 Afghanistan in 2001, Iraq in 2003 \u2014 could have been avoided. In Afghanistan, our demand on the Taliban \u2014 that it turn over Osama bin Laden and his associates \u2014 was not pursued. The Taliban was beginning to respond to our demand, but instead we invaded.\n\nIn Iraq, there was even less reason to send our troops. We invaded because, we said, Iraq was preparing mass-destruction weapons to use to attack us, which was later shown to be highly unlikely.\n\nSo in both Afghanistan and Iraq, we took military action that could have been avoided. Both invasions had predictable consequences that were negative for the target country and for ourselves.\n\nAnd this does not include the thousands killed, maimed, or otherwise wounded among our own forces and among the populations of those countries.\n\nNow we have to live with the political reality in both Iraq and in Afghanistan. We are leaving both countries in shambles. If we don\u2019t like the governments we see, we have no one to blame but ourselves.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: John B.

The U.S. went to war there to stop terrorists just like in Afghanistan. Obama has decided that the Afghan government appears that it won't fall apart. So, now it\u2019s OK to head for the exit.

But leaving Iraq wasn't easy. Now we are about to remove our military from Afghanistan and could face some of the same problems we had in Iraq. Governments in both these countries are not doing as we think they should, but our military's exit is not the reason for that.\n\nWe are learning a hard lesson. Our military can remove a government from power. However, we cannot decide what government will come next. It is a lesson that we need to pay attention to now. There is talk that the U.S. military might get involved in Syria, where a civil war has raged for three years.\n\nPresident George W. Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Saddam Hussein was the president then. The U.S. removed him from power. But, it seems that Bush gave little thought to what kind of leaders would come after Hussein.\n\nIn 1991, his father, President George H.W. Bush, attacked Iraq after it took over Kuwait. Some of our leaders in Congress didn't just want Iraq kicked out of Kuwait. They wanted Bush to order an attack on the capital city, Baghdad, to remove Saddam Hussein from power.\n\nWisely, Bush senior knew that such action would create many new problems. Under Saddam Hussein, the Sunni community had power. Sunnis are a minority in Iraq who follow one of the two main forms of Islam. The Shiites there are the majority. They practice the other form of Islam. Hussein was a Sunni who treated the Shiite community badly and killed many.\n\nIt should have been easy to see in Iraq that any new government there would be led by the Shiite community. Since they are the majority, it makes sense that they would win elections. Then there was the chance that the Shiites might seek justice for their suffering under Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe Shiites have gained power because of our invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe Sunni in Iraq are reacting now with violence. Fighting between Sunnis and Shiites breaks out daily in Iraq.\n\nU.S. Has Little Choice\n\nIn 2001 in Afghanistan, we removed a harsh government headed by the religious extremist Taliban party. Afghanistan is home to a number of ethnic groups but has never had a government that could truly unite the whole country. Warlords had always ruled different parts of the country. We knew this at the time.\n\nNow the warlords who ruled areas in Afghanistan are making a comeback. Elections are to be held soon. One of those warlords may wind up as the next president. Hamid Karzai is the current president. We are having trouble convincing him to let our troops remain in large numbers past the end of 2014.\n\nIn both Afghanistan and Iraq, we took military action that could have been avoided. In Afghanistan, we demanded that the Taliban turn over Osama bin Laden. The Taliban was beginning to respond to our demand. Instead, we invaded.\n\nIn Iraq, there was even less reason to send our troops. We invaded because, we said, Iraq was preparing powerful weapons to use to attack us. This turned out to be highly unlikely.\n\nThose invasions damaged both those countries and ourselves.\n\nThousands of our own forces were killed or wounded. Thousands of Afghans and Iraqis were also killed or wounded.\n\nNow we have to live with the situation in both Iraq and in Afghanistan. We are leaving both countries in shambles. We may not like the governments we see. But, we have no one to blame but ourselves.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: John B.

But the withdrawals are not the reason that we find ourselves dealing with governments in both these countries that are not doing as we think they should.\n\nWe are learning a hard lesson. While our military can remove an existing government, we cannot dictate what will replace it. It is a huge lesson we can learn from right now, because in recent days we are hearing new rumblings about the U.S. possibly getting its military involved in Syria, where a civil war is raging.\n\nIn Iraq, President George W. Bush apparently gave little thought to what might replace the government of then leader Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn 1991, when his father, President George H.W. Bush, attacked Iraq over its invasion and occupation of Kuwait, he was urged by some in Congress to expand the operation. These congressmen wanted him to attack Iraq's capital city, Baghdad, and remove Saddam Hussein from power.\n\nWisely, he knew that such action would open a can of worms. Under Saddam Hussein, power rested in the hands of the Sunni community. Sunnis are a minority within Iraq who practice one style of Islam. The majority Shiite community practices a somewhat different type of Islam and was resentful over its treatment at the hands of Saddam Hussein. Removing Saddam Hussein from power would upset the existing order, Bush realized.\n\nWhat was not difficult to see in Iraq was the likelihood that any new government there would be dominated by the majority Shiite community. Then there was the chance that it might seek justice for its suffering in a way that would leave the country in chaos.\n\nNow we see current Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki tilting toward the Shiites. That is the result of the situation we created with our invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nThe Sunni in Iraq are reacting now with violence. Whether we are there with troops or not, that difficult relationship between Sunni and Shiite is playing itself out as violence between the two groups breaks out on a daily basis.\n\nNor was it difficult to guess that a Shiite-led government in Iraq would be on good terms with the government of Iran, as Iran has a Shiite government as well. Since the Iranian revolution in 1979, we have been at odds with Iran's leaders. By invading Iraq, we boosted support in the region for the government of Iran.\n\nNo One To Blame But Ourselves\n\nIn Afghanistan, we removed a government headed by the Taliban, an extreme religious political group. Afghanistan, as was known at the time, had a population made of many different ethnic groups who have never come together to form a country-wide political order.\n\nNow the warlords who ruled small fiefdoms in Afghanistan are making a comeback. One of them may wind up as the next president in elections to be held soon. We are having trouble convincing Hamid Karzai, the current president, to let our troops remain in large numbers past the end of 2014. We want to keep Afghan courts from having legal authority over any offenses that may be committed in the future by U.S. military there. Karzai rejects this demand.\n\nIn both instances, our military invasions \u2014 Afghanistan in 2001, Iraq in 2003 \u2014 could have been avoided. In Afghanistan, our demand on the Taliban \u2014 that it turn over Osama bin Laden and his associates \u2014 was not pursued. The Taliban was beginning to respond to our demand, but instead we invaded.\n\nIn Iraq, there was even less reason to send our troops. We invaded because, we said, Iraq was preparing mass-destruction weapons to use to attack us. That reason was quickly shown to be highly unlikely.\n\nSo in both Afghanistan and Iraq, we took military action that could have been avoided. Our invasions caused predictable problems that were damaging both for those countries and for ourselves.\n\nAnd this does not include the thousands killed or wounded among our own forces, and among the populations of those countries.\n\nNow we have to live with the political situation in both Iraq and in Afghanistan. We are leaving both countries in shambles. If we don\u2019t like the governments we see, we have no one to blame but ourselves.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: John B.

Photo: Carolyn Cole/Los Angeles Times/MCT\nPRO: A pullout is the wrong move\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Henry Kissinger used to be U.S. secretary of state and he won the Nobel Peace Prize. By all measures, he's a heavyweight in the world of international relations. At a recent gathering, he stood \u2014 peering commandingly over his signature thick, black-frame glasses \u2014 and remarked: \"Withdrawal is not victory.\u201d\n\nHe was referring to the U.S. decision to pull its military out of Afghanistan.\n\nKissinger knows a thing or two about the pain of walking away. He negotiated the Paris Peace Treaty that ended the Vietnam War. Then he watched on as Congress pulled the plug on all support for South Vietnam in its war against North Vietnam.\n\nAmerica\u2019s 25-year effort in Vietnam was wasted. The North Vietnamese rolled over the South, with the support of the Soviet Union, our former enemy. Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were engulfed in brutality and widespread killing. The Soviet Union, a group of republics controlled by Russia, was strengthened. It supported new revolutions in South America and Africa. The Soviets fostered a wave of Islamist terrorism across the Middle East.\n\nMany Vietnam War protesters see America\u2019s withdrawal as a triumph. But, there is no reason to be proud of how we left. We can still debate the wisdom of going to war there. That our total abandonment of our allies left a bloody and shameful history is not in doubt.\n\nKissinger\u2019s comments weren\u2019t meant to bring up ancient history. He was complaining about history repeating itself. The prospects are now high that Afghanistan will fail \u2026 needlessly.\n\nFurther Commitment Still Needed\n\nThe Obama government's Afghan plan is a near copy of its withdrawal from Iraq. It has decided that the Afghan government appears that it won't fall apart. So, now it\u2019s OK to head for the exit. But just because the government isn't in danger of immediate failure doesn't mean that we can declare victory. It's no better than when George W. Bush declared \u201cmission accomplished\u201d just after invading Iraq.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that the United States should plan major, unending commitments to a country after a fight. But once the levels of violence have come down, some further commitment is usually necessary. The U.S. may need to stick around to help peace and safety become normal and let a strong government take root.\n\nIraq is a case study in how to get it wrong. It is absurd to argue that the White House could not have gotten permission to keep a small force there. It simply didn\u2019t want to. It is also clear that the U.S. pullout left space that was eagerly filled by al-Qaida as it regained its strength. Today, Iraq suffers much higher levels of violence than when Obama took office.\n\nThe prospects for Afghanistan are even grimmer. Obama\u2019s Afghan \u201csurge\u201d of sending additional troops to wipe out al-Qaida did not nearly have the same effect as the Bush surge in Iraq. In certain areas of Pakistan, the Taliban can still operate freely; the Haqqani Network of Islamic rebels is as strong as ever and al-Qaida is waiting for its moment. Terrorist attacks against the government are paid for by an illegal drug trade that is still going strong. These are daunting challenges for the Afghan people.\n\nObama talks of finishing the job in Afghanistan. Yet, many in the government would be delighted to have no U.S. troops there, period. But it\u2019s not clear that a small army of troops from other countries will be enough to hold the hard-won gains there.\n\nThe U.S. went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan to crush the terrorist forces that had killed thousands of Americans on Sept. 11, 2001. Those terrorists threatened to kill many, many more. Job 1 was not to bring freedom and justice to those lands. But America always prefers to leave a path to liberty in the wake of its wars.\n\nSadly in the case of Afghanistan, Obama seems ready to repeat the mistake he made in Iraq. Future U.S. governments will be affected by the chaos we leave behind and will have to deal with it \u2014 probably at greater cost. \u201cWithdrawal is not victory.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: James Jay Carafano is vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nThis essay is available to McClatchy-Tribune News Service subscribers.

We have found ourselves dealing with new governments in both these countries that are not doing as we think they should. But, the withdrawals are not the reason for that.\n\nWe are learning a hard lesson. Our military can remove an existing government. However, we cannot decide what will replace it. It is a lesson with importance for the future. In recent days we are hearing new rumblings that the U.S. may possibly get involved in the civil war in Syria.\n\nPresident George W. Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq in 2003, but it seems he gave little thought to what might replace the government of its leader Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn 1991 his father, President George H.W. Bush, attacked Iraq after it took over Kuwait. Some in Congress urged him to expand the operation to attack Iraq's capital city, Baghdad, and remove Saddam Hussein from power.\n\nWisely, he knew that such action would create many more problems. Under Saddam Hussein, the Sunni community held the power. Sunnis are a minority within Iraq who follow one kind of Islam. The majority Shiite community practices a somewhat different type of Islam, and they were resentful over their treatment at the hands of Saddam Hussein.\n\nIt was not difficult to see in Iraq that any new government there would likely be led by the Shiite community. Since they are the majority, free elections would naturally give them the lead. Then there was the chance the Shiites might seek justice for their suffering. There was always the chance that would leave the country in chaos.\n\nNow we see current Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki beginning to favor the Shiites. That is the result of the situation we set up with our invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nThe Sunni in Iraq are reacting now with violence. Whether we are there with troops or not, that difficult relationship between Sunni and Shiite is playing itself out. Fighting between Sunnis and Shiites breaks out daily in Iraq.\n\nWe should have known that a Shiite-led government in Iraq would be on good terms with the government of Iran. Iran is a majority Shiite country, with a Shiite government. We have have had very poor relations with Iran since the country had a revolution in 1979. With a Shiite government in Iraq, the government of Iran has grown stronger.\n\nMade Both Countries A Shambles\n\nIn Afghanistan, we removed the Taliban, a government that ruled under a extremely strict form of Islam. Afghanistan is home to a variety of ethnic groups. It has no history of a government with control over the entire country. Before the Taliban, different warlords controlled areas of the country.\n\nNow the warlords who ruled small fiefdoms in Afghanistan are making a comeback. One of them may wind up as the next president in elections to be held soon. We are having trouble convincing Hamid Karzai, the current president, to let our troops remain in large numbers past the end of 2014.\n\nBoth our military invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 could have been avoided. In Afghanistan, we demanded that the Taliban turn over Osama bin Laden. The Taliban was beginning to respond to our demand, but instead we invaded.\n\nIn Iraq, there was even less reason to send our troops. We invaded because, we said, Iraq was preparing powerful weapons to use to attack us. That reason was quickly shown to be highly unlikely.\n\nSo in both Afghanistan and Iraq, we took military action that could have been avoided. Our invasions had predictable effects that damaged both those countries and ourselves.\n\nAnd this does not include the thousands killed or wounded among our own forces. Thousands of Afghans and Iraqis were also killed or wounded.\n\nNow we have to live with the political situation in both Iraq and in Afghanistan. We are leaving both countries in shambles. If we don\u2019t like the governments we see, we have no one to blame but ourselves.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: John B.

As our history books show, the Volstead Act, prohibition of alcohol in the 1920s, closed the doors of legal, regulated businesses and opened a Pandora's box with unintended consequences.\n\nThese consequences \u2014 criminal activity, illegal manufacturing and distribution, and more \u2014 took years and significant resources to fully combat. All for the act to later be repealed.\n\nLet's not let history repeat itself. Americans enjoy entertainment, especially gambling. Gambling is woven into American history, having existed in some form since our nation's establishment.\n\nLet's rely on common-sense safeguards and consumer protections by extending well-established and effective gaming regulations to the newest form, online gaming, at the onset \u2014 not retroactively.\n\nNaively assuming a ban would absolve American's interest and participation in online gaming sets up local, state and federal law enforcement with tremendous expenses and turn millions of average American citizens into criminals.\n\nThe black market exists. Today's unregulated online operators are flouting their products in clear violation of state and federal law with no regulatory controls or tax obligations.\n\nEstimates show growth in unregulated online gaming markets is explosive: an estimated 1 million Americans or more spend nearly $3 billion annually on overseas gaming sites. Most of these Americans aren't criminals; they're simply looking to participate in the newest form of gaming \u2014 online.\n\nThe U.S. should harness this practice, not vilify or ignore it. Moreover, the billions of dollars this new form of gaming technology generates presents a healthy funding model to cover costs associated with regulation and legal enforcement.\n\nModern technologies associated with online gaming exist to protect consumers \u2014 including minors, gambling addicts and others \u2014 and these safeguards are being tested in states such as New Jersey that allow for online gaming within its state borders. These technologies, while not perfect, will continue to improve for the financial, health care and gaming industries.\n\nMoreover, when properly implemented, the tax revenue generated through online gaming can cover not only the necessary expenses to ensure consumer protections for Americans but also to support local communities' budget deficits to pay for essential public services such as education.\n\nAs with previous versions of draft legislation, states and licensed industry participants should have the option of whether they support online gaming at all. For those that do, many will likely limit online gaming to competitive poker only.\n\nIt's no secret that many state and local governments are woefully in need of new revenue streams. Online gaming holds the potential to assist with these budgetary shortfalls.\n\nState lotteries are a perfect example of leveraging long-standing entertainment to help subsidize public-sector treasuries. However, the large number of states that have kept up with 21st-century technologies by offering online lottery would also be jeopardized through wide-sweeping federal prohibition.\n\nThe slippery slope of a proposed ban, doesn't stop at the state level. The Fantasy Sports Trade Association was recently warned that popular sports fantasy leagues could end up banned by this legislation as well.\n\nIt wouldn't be surprising if other forms of popular online gaming \u2014 through social media channels such as Facebook and others \u2014 were brought under scrutiny through federal prohibition, too.\n\nAmerica is well known for its entrepreneurs. Innovators like Henry Ford, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and others are as tied to American history as U.S. presidents and policymakers.\n\nLet not the federal government impede innovation. Set up the parameters to let Americans innovate \u2014and play \u2014 on a level playing field with the rest of the world.\n\nInstead of pretending that innovation and the Internet doesn't or shouldn't exist, America should look back to both our historical mistakes and our historical innovations for inspiration on how to best navigate the challenges and opportunities associated with Internet gaming today.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Mark Lipparelli is the founder of Gioco Ventures and former chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board.

It\u2019s good news for them: After seven straight years of sinking profits, the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada predicts that if brick-and-mortar casinos continue to shrink at the same rate as this year, their online presence will have to double to make up for lost revenue.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise then that states like Nevada and New Jersey, who have grown reliant on gambling revenues, are taking advantage of the Department of Justice\u2019s 2011 decision gutting the Wire Act to expand gambling online.\n\nBe careful what you bet on. Experts have expressed concern over Internet gambling for years.\n\nIn 1999, the National Gambling Impact Study Commission (NGISC) recommended an explicit moratorium on gambling expansion and a complete ban of Internet gambling until more research could be done on its harms and benefits. Unfortunately this research has not been done and online gambling advocates are petitioning Congress to approve a regulatory regime that would help them spread online gambling nationwide and give them the trappings of a legalized market \u2014 most important among these, the illusion that online gambling is somehow safe.\n\nOnline gambling will increase availability. But where there is an increase in availability there\u2019s also a documented increase in incidences of problem gambling and the attendant social harms of bankruptcy, divorce, incarceration, suicide.\n\nAdvocates for online gambling say problem gamblers make up only a small percentage of overall players, but that does not take into account ripple effects. Studies estimate that a compulsive gambler will affect an average of five to 10 other people.\n\nEven recovering problem gamblers may not be able to undo the damage done to their finances and relationships, particularly their marriages.\n\nThe NGISC reported receiving \u201cabundant testimony and evidence that compulsive gambling introduces a greatly heightened level of stress and tension into marriages and families, often culminating in divorce and other manifestations of familial disharmony,\u201d and that \u201crespondents representing 2 million adults identified a spouse\u2019s gambling as a significant factor in a prior divorce.\u201d\n\nThe total costs to society are untold. The increase in crime, financial hardship, lost work and family break-up have led Baylor University professor Earl L. Grinols to estimate the cost of gambling to outweigh its benefits by 3-to-1.\n\nInternet gambling is particularly worrisome because evidence overwhelmingly shows that compulsive gambling is three to four times more prevalent among online gamblers than non-Internet gamblers.\n\nThe 24/7 ease of access, speed of the game, lack of clear cash markers, solitary nature of play and ability to play multiple games at once make online gambling inherently more dangerous than other forms of gambling.\n\nOnline gambling vendors claim they will be able to screen out minors, ensure a player\u2019s identity and validate that players are physically located within proper jurisdictions.\n\nHowever, the FBI countered this claim in a 2009 letter to the Financial Services Committee stating, \u201cWhile the (online gambling) vendors may claim that they can validate age and location, they are more than likely relying on credit card information and geo-location to gather this information. Both can be spoofed.\u201d\n\nWhile legalizing online gambling may seem like an attractive solution to a state\u2019s budget woes, evidence suggests the contrary. Gambling is a regressive tax that disproportionately impacts the poor, diverting money away from local businesses and displacing existing sales tax revenue while fueling societal ills.\n\nBoth sides of this debate agree a state-by-state patchwork of online gambling regimes will not work. Congress needs to act in the interest of families and communities by updating the Wire Act to ensure enforcement of federal law prohibiting Internet gambling.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Nick Frase is a government affairs research assistant at the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian organization.

In the 1920s, the government tried a similar thing when it introduced Prohibition, which banned the sale of alcohol. As our history books show, Prohibition closed the doors of many good businesses. And it led to severe side effects.\n\nThese effects \u2014 criminal activity, illegal manufacturing and selling of booze, and more \u2014 took years to fight. And that battle cost significant public money. All for nothing, because Prohibition was later ended.\n\nLet's not let history repeat itself. Some people want to pass a law ending online gambling. Americans enjoy entertainment, especially gambling. Gambling is part of American history. Since our nation's founding, it\u2019s existed in some form or another.\n\nLet's use common sense. We can apply protections used at casinos to online gaming.\n\nMaking Use Of Online Gambling\n\nIt would be silly to think that blocking gambling would stop Americans from gambling online. It would happen anyway. All that would be accomplished is that police would be forced to crack down on gamblers. And millions of average American citizens would be turned into criminals.\n\nThe black market exists. Today's gambling websites are clearly against state and federal law. There are no regulatory controls or responsibility for the websites to pay taxes. They get away with it because they're based in foreign countries.\n\nUnregulated online gaming is exploding: an estimated 1 million Americans or more spend nearly $3 billion annually on overseas gaming sites. Most of these Americans aren't criminals; they're simply looking to get in on in the newest form of gaming \u2014 online.\n\nThe U.S. should make use of gambling, not criticize or ignore it. The billions of dollars online gambling generates could pay for services Americans need. The money can be put toward paying for people to monitor the gambling online, for instance.\n\nModern technologies used in online gaming exist to protect Americans. They can prevent minors and problem gamblers from betting. Safeguards are being tested in states such as New Jersey that allow online gaming within state borders. These technologies are not perfect, but will continue to improve.\n\nMoreover, when properly put into action, the taxes generated through online gaming can cover the cost of regulating it. Leftover money can help cities and states pay for public services such as education.\n\nStates and casino operators should have a say in whether they want to offer online gaming at all. For those that do, many will likely limit online gaming to competitive poker only.\n\nDomino Effect Of A Ban\n\nIt's no secret that many state and local governments desperately need new sources of money. Online gaming could help cities and states get the money they need.\n\nState lotteries are a perfect example of using entertainment to raise money for good purposes. Large numbers of states offer online lotteries. States use lottery money to pay for many things they need. Even lotteries would also be at risk of being shut down by government prohibition.\n\nBanning online gambling could have a domino effect. Popular fantasy sports leagues might have to end under this law as well. The fantasy leagues allow participants to choose players from any team in basketball, football, baseball or any other group of professional athletes. Then, they can create a made-up \"team\" of their favorite players. They might bet money on whether the players on their team play well in real life.\n\nIt wouldn't be surprising if other forms of popular online gaming were investigated under a prohibition, too. Facebook and other social media feature games that might be looked at closely.\n\nAmerica is well known for business people who have created exciting new technologies. Inspiring businessmen like Henry Ford, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and others are as tied to American history as U.S. presidents.\n\nWe shouldn't let the government prevent new technologies. Other countries are already in on online gaming. We need to get on board, too.\n\nPretending that things don't change or that the Internet doesn't exist is pointless. America should instead look back at our historical mistake with the prohibition of alcohol. And we should look to the technologies America has developed in the past to inspire us. They will show us how to navigate the challenges and opportunities associated with Internet gaming today.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Mark Lipparelli is the founder of Gioco Ventures and former chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board.

It\u2019s good news for them. Casinos in those cities have had been making less and less money for seven years. The University of Nevada studied what would happen if casino profits continue to shrink. It found that if this continues, casinos will have to double their online gambling websites to make up for the money their casino houses are losing.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise then that states like Nevada and New Jersey are jumping into online gambling. Both states rely on the money gambling brings in to pay for services, like education.\n\nOnline gambling became possible when the Department of Justice (DOJ) gutted the Wire Act in 2011, which had banned online gambling. But, then the DOJ decided that only Internet gambling on sports was illegal.\n\nBe careful what you bet on. Experts have expressed concern over Internet gambling for years.\n\nProblem Gamblers Hurt Families\n\nCongress set up the National Gambling Impact Study Commission (NGISC) to look into the effects of gambling on Americans. In 1999, it recommended there be no new casinos. And it recommended that Internet gambling be blocked entirely. It said more research was needed on gambling's harms and benefits. Unfortunately this has not happened.\n\nAnd online gambling supporters are asking Congress for new laws. They want to spread online gambling nationwide. Allowing this would give the false appearance that online gambling is somehow safe.\n\nOnline gambling will make gambling easier. But where there is an increase in availability of gambling, there\u2019s also a documented increase in problem gambling. Abuse of gambling leads to people running out of money, collapsing marriages, and jail. Sometimes people even end their own lives.\n\nPromoters of online gambling say problem gamblers make up only a small percentage of overall players. But, the numbers don't take into account ripple effects. Studies show that a problem gambler will affect an average of five to 10 other people.\n\nEven recovering problem gamblers may not be able to undo the damage done. Gamblers can lose enormous amounts of money. Their problem can destroy relationships, particularly their marriages. Couples may separate or divorce because of gambling.\n\nThe NGISC said it found plenty of proof that problem gambling increases anxiety in marriages and families. Its survey of Americans found that gambling problems were a strong cause of divorce.\n\nGambling's Big Cost To Society\n\nThe total cost to society cannot be known. The increase in crime, money problems, lost jobs and family break-up damage our society. They have led Baylor University professor Earl L. Grinols to estimate the cost of gambling to outweigh its benefits by 3-to-1.\n\nInternet gambling is particularly worrisome. Evidence overwhelmingly shows that problem gambling is three to four times more common among online gamblers than non-Internet gamblers.\n\nOnline gambling is clearly more dangerous than other forms of gambling. It's available 24/7 and games move quickly. People often play games alone \u2014 and play several games at once. It's possible to lose more money than you actually have.\n\nOnline gambling companies claim they will be able to screen out minors. The companies say they can ensure that players are who they say they are. They say they can also validate that players are physically located where they say they are.\n\nHowever, the FBI has countered this claim. In a 2009 letter to Congress, it stated that online gambling sites claim that they can validate age and location. However, \"they are more than likely relying on credit card information and geo-location to gather this information.

In the 1920s, the sale of alcohol was banned by the government. It was called Prohibition. Many businesses were forced to go under because of it. And it led to severe side effects.\n\nThe effects included bad, criminal behavior. People illegally made and sold booze. The government spent years trying to stop it. It cost a lot of public money. In the end, the government canceled Prohibition.\n\nLet's not make the same mistake twice. Americans enjoy entertainment, especially gambling. Gambling is part of American history. Since our nation's founding, it\u2019s existed in some form or another.\n\nWe just need to protect against the problems gambling can bring. Let's take the rules that work at casinos and use them for online gaming.\n\nOnline Gambling Is Here\n\nIt would be silly to think blocking gambling would stop Americans from getting into online gaming. It would happen anyway. All it would do is cost police money to deal with it. And millions of average American citizens would be turned into criminals.\n\nThe black market exists already. Today's gambling websites are unregulated. There are no rules and they don't have to pay taxes. It is illegal. But, most online casinos are in other countries, so they get away with it.\n\nUnregulated online gaming is exploding: an estimated 1 million Americans are involved. In total, they spend nearly $3 billion annually on overseas gaming websites. Most of these Americans aren't criminals; they're simply looking to get into the newest form of gaming \u2014 online.\n\nThe U.S. shouldn't demonize or ignore it. Moreover, the money from this new form of gaming technology could pay for services Americans need. The money can be put toward covering the costs of education, for instance. And it could pay for dealing with the problems that sometimes come from gambling.\n\nModern technologies used in online gaming are there to protect Americans. They can prevent young people and problem gamblers from betting. And these safeguards are being tested in states such as New Jersey that allow for online gaming within its state borders. These technologies, while not perfect, will continue to improve.\n\nStates and casino operators may not even want that much online gambling. Many will likely limit online gaming to competitive poker only.\n\nIt's no secret that many state and city governments desperately need money. Online gaming holds the potential to help cities and states get the money they need.\n\nLook At Lotteries\n\nState lotteries are a perfect example of using entertainment to raise money for good purposes. Large numbers of states now offer online lotteries. They would also be endangered by government prohibition.\n\nThe slippery slope of a possible ban doesn't stop at the state level. The Fantasy Sports Trade Association was recently warned that popular sports fantasy leagues could be banned by this legislation as well.\n\nFantasy sports teams are created by choosing your favorite players from a sport like baseball and creating a made-up \"team.\" Fantasy football is very popular. When the people who make the fantasy teams bet money that their players will score the most points, it is considered gambling.\n\nIt wouldn't be surprising if other forms of popular online gaming were prohibited by the government too. Facebook and other social media feature games that might be regulated.\n\nAmericans are well known for their ability to start businesses from scratch. Innovators like Henry Ford, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and others are as tied to American history as U.S. presidents.\n\nLet's not let the government hold back new technology. Other countries around the world are already doing it. We need to keep up.\n\nPretending that progress, new ideas and the Internet don't or shouldn't exist is pointless. America should look back at our past mistakes. And we should look at how we've been inspired in the past. They will show us how to handle the challenges and opportunities that come from Internet gaming today.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Mark Lipparelli is the founder of Gioco Ventures and former chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board.

It\u2019s good news for them. Casinos in those cities don't make money like they used to. For seven straight years they've made less and less. The University of Nevada studied what would happen if this continues and found that casinos would have to double their online gambling to make up for lost money at their casinos.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise then that states like Nevada and New Jersey want to increase online gambling. Both states rely on the money gambling brings in. It pays for the services the states provide, such as education.\n\nOnline gambling became possible in 2011. An old law used to not allow it. But, then the government decided that only Internet betting on sports had to be blocked.\n\nBe careful what you bet on. Experts have expressed concern over Internet gambling for years.\n\nToo Easy To Gamble Too Much\n\nCongress set up a group to study the effects of gambling. In 1999, the group recommended there be no new casinos. It also told the government to block Internet gambling entirely. It said more studies were needed on the harms and benefits of online gambling. But this has not happened yet.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters of online gambling are asking the government for more. They want permission to spread online gambling nationwide.\n\nOnline gambling will make it easier to gamble anytime. An increase in gambling leads to more problem gambling. Some people can't control their gambling and get into trouble. The problems with gambling have been well documented. Too much gambling leads to people running out of money, destroyed marriages, and jail.\n\nPromoters of online gambling say there aren't many problem gamblers. They say they make up only a small number of overall players. But, the numbers don't show how problem gamblers affect others. Studies show that a problem gambler affects five to 10 other people.\n\nProblem gamblers may be able to quit gambling. Even then, the damage may not be fixed. Gamblers can lose enormous amounts of money. Their problem can destroy relationships. Marriages can be torn apart. Couples may separate or divorce because of gambling.\n\nThe cost to society from gambling is huge. It's so big it can't be known. Gambling leads to an increase in crime and money problems. Lost jobs and broken families damage our society. Baylor University professor Earl L. Grinols calculates that the cost of gambling probably outweighs its benefits by 3-to-1.\n\nEnd Internet Gambling\n\nInternet gambling is particularly worrisome. Problem gambling is more common online than in casinos. In fact, it's three to four times more likely.\n\nOnline gambling is more dangerous than other forms of gambling. People can play all of the time and games go quickly. People play games alone \u2014 and play several games at once. People can lose more money than they have.\n\nOnline gambling companies claim they can stop young people from gambling online. They say they can screen people by age.\n\nHowever, the FBI has countered this claim. In 2009 it wrote a letter to Congress. The letter stated that online gambling sites \"are more than likely relying on credit card information\" to gather this information. That information could be faked.\n\nLegalizing online gambling may seem like the answer to a state\u2019s money problems. Evidence, however, suggests the opposite. Gambling hurts the poor more than the rich. And it takes money away from local businesses.\n\nStates can't be allowed to set their own online gambling rules. Congress needs to aid families and communities. It should end Internet gambling.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Nick Frase is a government affairs research assistant at the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian organization.\n\nThis essay is available to McClatchy-Tribune News Service subscribers.

We've tried it before. As our history books show, the Volstead Act, which prohibited the sale of alcohol in the 1920s, closed the doors of legal, regulated businesses. In their place, it opened a Pandora's box with unintended consequences.\n\nThese consequences \u2014 criminal activity, illegal manufacturing and distribution, and more \u2014 took years and significant resources to fully combat. All for the act to later be repealed.\n\nLet's not let history repeat itself. Americans enjoy entertainment, especially gambling. Gambling is woven into American history, having existed in some form since our nation's establishment.\n\nLet's rely on common-sense safeguards and consumer protections. Let's extend well-established and effective gaming regulations to the newest form, online gaming.\n\nUnregulated Online Gambling's Growth\n\nBlindly assuming a ban would end American's interest and participation in online gaming sets up local, state and federal law enforcement with tremendous expenses. And it would turn millions of average American citizens into criminals.\n\nThe black market exists already. Today's unregulated gambling websites are in clear violation of state and federal law and face no regulatory controls or tax obligations.\n\nEstimates show growth in unregulated online gaming is explosive: an estimated 1 million Americans or more spend nearly $3 billion annually on overseas gaming sites. Most of these Americans aren't criminals; they're simply looking to participate in the newest form of gaming \u2014 online.\n\nThe U.S. should profit from online gambling, not vilify or ignore it. Moreover, the billions of dollars this new form of gaming technology generates could help cover costs associated with regulation and legal enforcement.\n\nModern technologies associated with online gaming exist to protect consumers \u2014 including minors, problem gamblers and others. Safeguards are being tested in states such as New Jersey that allow for online gaming within its state borders. The technologies, while not perfect, will continue to improve.\n\nMoreover, when properly implemented, the tax revenue generated through online gaming can cover the necessary expenses to ensure consumer protections for Americans. Money left over can support local communities' budget shortfalls to pay for essential public services such as education.\n\nAs with previous versions of draft legislation, states and casino operators should have the option of whether they support online gaming at all. For those that do, many will likely limit online gaming to competitive poker only.\n\nWhere Would A Ban End?\n\nIt's no secret that many state and local governments are woefully in need of new revenue streams. Online gaming holds the potential to assist with these budgetary shortfalls.\n\nState lotteries are a perfect example of using entertainment to help subsidize the needs of state and local governments. A large number of states have kept up with 21st-century technologies by offering online lotteries. Wide-sweeping federal prohibition might endanger lotteries as well.\n\nThe slippery slope of a proposed ban doesn't stop at the state level. The Fantasy Sports Trade Association was recently warned that popular sports fantasy leagues could be banned by this legislation as well.\n\nIt wouldn't be surprising if other forms of popular online gaming were brought under scrutiny through federal prohibition, too. Facebook and other social media host games that might be investigated.\n\nAmerica is well known for its entrepreneurs. Innovators like Henry Ford, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and others are as tied to American history as U.S. presidents and policymakers.\n\nLet not federal government hinder innovation. Set up the rules so Americans can innovate \u2014and play \u2014 on a level playing field with the rest of the world.\n\nPretending that innovation and the Internet doesn't or shouldn't exist is pointless. America should instead look back to both our historical mistakes and our historical innovations for inspiration on how to best navigate the challenges and opportunities associated with Internet gaming today.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Mark Lipparelli is the founder of Gioco Ventures and former chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board.

It\u2019s good news for them: After seven straight years of sinking profits, the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada predicts that if physical casinos continue to see profits shrink at the same rate as this year, their online gambling will have to double to make up for lost revenue.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise then that states like Nevada and New Jersey are jumping into online gambling. Both states rely on the money gambling brings in to pay for services \u2014 like education \u2014 for their residents.\n\nThe expansion of internet gambling was made possible by the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) 2011 decision gutting the Wire Act. The act had previously banned internet gambling. But, the DOJ concluded that only online sports betting needed to be banned.\n\nBe careful what you bet on. Experts have expressed concern over Internet gambling for years.\n\nProblem Gambling Could Rise\n\nIn 1999, the National Gambling Impact Study Commission (NGISC) recommended a moratorium on gambling expansion. And it asked for a complete ban of Internet gambling. It said more research needed to be done on its harms and benefits. Unfortunately this research has not happened. And online gambling advocates are petitioning Congress to approve regulations that would help them spread online gambling nationwide and give them the functions of a legalized market \u2014 most important among these, the illusion that online gambling is somehow safe.\n\nOnline gambling will increase gambling's availability. But where there is an increase in availability there\u2019s also a documented increase in occurrences of problem gambling. These lead to the accompanying social harms of bankruptcy, divorce, prison sentences, suicide.\n\nAdvocates for online gambling say problem gamblers make up only a small percentage of overall players. But, the numbers don't take into account ripple effects. Studies estimate that a problem gambler will affect an average of five to 10 other people.\n\nEven recovering problem gamblers may not be able to undo the damage done. Gamblers can ruin their finances and relationships, particularly their marriages.\n\nThe NGISC reported receiving \u201cabundant testimony and evidence that compulsive gambling introduces a greatly heightened level of stress and tension into marriages and families, often culminating in divorce and other manifestations of familial disharmony.\u201d It also found that \u201crespondents representing 2 million adults identified a spouse\u2019s gambling as a significant factor in a prior divorce.\u201d\n\nThe total costs to society are immense. The increase in crime, financial hardship, lost work and family break-up have consequences for our society. They have led Baylor University professor Earl L. Grinols to estimate the cost of gambling to outweigh its benefits by 3-to-1.\n\nOnline Gambling More Dangerous\n\nInternet gambling is particularly worrisome. Evidence overwhelmingly shows that compulsive gambling is three to four times more common among online gamblers than non-Internet gamblers.\n\nOnline gambling is fundamentally more dangerous than other forms of gambling. The 24/7 ease of access, speed of the game, solitary nature of play and ability to play multiple games at once make it so. It's also possible to lose more money than you have on hand.\n\nOnline gambling vendors claim they will be able to screen out minors, ensure a player\u2019s identity and validate that players are physically located where they say they are.\n\nHowever, the FBI has countered this claim. In a 2009 letter to the Financial Services Committee it stated, \u201cWhile the (online gambling) vendors may claim that they can validate age and location, they are more than likely relying on credit card information and geo-location to gather this information. Both can be spoofed.\u201d\n\nLegalizing online gambling may seem like an attractive solution to a state\u2019s budget woes. Evidence, however, suggests the contrary. Gambling disproportionately impacts the poor. It diverts money away from local businesses and displaces existing sales tax revenue while fueling societal ills.\n\nBoth sides of this debate agree a state-by-state patchwork of online gambling regimes will not work. Congress needs to act in the interest of families and communities.

Photo: AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite\nPRO: Leaked information on NSA wrongdoing\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Edward Snowden is a brave American hero.\n\nThe National Security Agency has been collecting information about nearly every phone call in America. It also has gathered information about emails. This was a huge violation of Americans' private lives. Snowden was the first person to let people know about it.\nHe will be remembered as a hero long after the \u201cwar on terror\u201d is over. By then our government will have some new excuse for violating Americans\u2019 rights and the rights of the rest of the world.\n\nOur government has tried to capture him. But, he won his first big court victory on Dec. 16. A judge ruled that the NSA's collecting of Americans\u2019 phone records was probably against the Constitution.\n\nSpying For Companies\n\nOur newspapers and TV news stations have let us down. They have reported that our government's spying is an effort to protect Americans from terrorism.\n\nBut our government's actions obviously had nothing to do with terrorism.\n\nOur government has spied on other countries. It did not do this to catch terrorists. It spied to help give the U.S. companies an advantage.\n\nThe NSA also spied on the phones of leaders from other countries, including Germany and Brazil.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: that\u2019s bad enough. Most people don\u2019t want to share the details of their private lives with government spies. But the Obama government has managed to convince some people that the NSA is just storing our private information and not using it.\n\nWe're led to believe that our private information is simply sorted by computers. It's just being used to find terrorists, we are told.\n\nHowever, there is a mountain of evidence that says the opposite. This widespread gathering of our private information is in fact being used against everyday citizens. All these Americans have done is join groups whose actions are protected by our Constitution. Our government has already spied on anti-war groups. Public educators have been targeted.\n\n\"Our Crooked Spy State\"\n\nOur government has the ability to use the NSA\u2019s information for the wrong purposes. It can mess with groups that don't agree with our government.\n\nIn 2011, the Boston police, Boston Regional Intelligence Center and the FBI were busy tracking people. But they were just members of protest groups, not terrorists.\n\nAs a result, they seem to have ignored important intelligence. Information was literally handed to them about the terrorists who bombed the Boston Marathon. This tells you a lot about what's important to our crooked spy state.\n\nIn the 1960s, Martin Luther King Jr. was inspiring millions in his fight for the rights of African-Americans and poor people.\n\nToday, it would have information on his every move and phone call. It would know about every activist in the civil rights struggle across the country. That is the difference that technology makes and it's important that we don't let our government get away with it.\n\nOur spy state is also making the U.S. into a country run by companies and the military. They're becoming more powerful compared to our elected leaders, including the president.\n\nAnd our military and spies are using their power in other ways. They're currently blocking attempts to cut down the NSA\u2019s bad actions.\n\nIt\u2019s not just your private life that is being invaded. Our entire democracy is being attacked.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Mark Weisbrot is the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.\n\nThis essay is available to McClatchy-Tribune News Service subscribers.

But he certainly is one in the way most people think of the word.\n\nHe made national security secrets public. He claims to have done this for a good reason. He wants to use the power of the Internet to make people aware of the wrongdoings of evil governments. But in fact, he has told us almost nothing about countries like North Korea, Iran, China, Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nInstead, he's mostly spilled secrets from nations considered to be the most free and open. These are democratic countries that hold elections. They're countries that put together peacekeeping and humanitarian missions to help people in need around the world. These countries work to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. They fight terrorism. They're the ones supporting human rights.\n\nHurt Supporters Of Freedom\n\nFor whatever reason he did it, Snowden\u2019s actions have hurt the countries that are the greatest supporters of freedom. And he's helped the world\u2019s most undemocratic countries.\n\nSnowden was doing the same thing as Julian Assange. Assange started WikiLeaks. That website also discloses government secrets.\n\nSnowden has betrayed the idea of freedom. The Snowden/Assange view of the world says that governments must be completely open about what they do. They think that equals freedom. This is not just being overly innocent \u2014 it's worse.\n\nRespect for our private lives is an essential part of freedom. The government of free peoples is part of the people. We elect it. The government rules for us. Free societies recognize that keeping some secrets is a necessary job of government.\n\nDemocracies operate under the idea of \u201cordered liberty.\u201d They establish rules to protect both the individual and the country as a whole. Democracies guard both individual freedom and the safety of its people. No one has the right to throw away those rules and make up their own. Disregarding ordered liberty doesn\u2019t advance freedom. It just creates chaos. And chaos enables evil and kills democracies like our own.\n\nSnowden is not a \u201cfreedom fighter.\u201d And he's not a \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d who is exposing bad activities by our government. His leaks are broad and all over the place. Most of them show no wrongdoing whatsoever.\n\nWas Supposed To Safeguard Secrets\n\nWhat about those cases where Snowden might argue he has revealed government actions that might cross the line? His actions are still, at best, irresponsible.\n\nThe United States system of ordered liberty offers several ways to raise claims of wrongdoing by our government. Those ways don't put our country in danger. Government agencies have inspectors. Congress routinely investigates claims of government wrongdoing.\n\nAnd, yes, we have \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d protection laws. These protect people from being attacked by a government whose bad actions they need to expose. But, the notion that Snowden had no choice but to leak secrets is indefensible.\n\nFinally, Snowden betrayed the trust he was given by the U.S. government. He was supposed to safeguard the nation\u2019s secrets.\n\nFree societies depend on trustworthy citizens. Bank tellers, lawyers, doctors, police officials and others are all in positions of trust. These people can't decide that they get to choose what information should or should not be dumped out for everyone to see.\n\nIf they did, we wouldn\u2019t be living in an open society. We would be living in North Korea, where no one is trusted \u2026 ever.\n\nEdward Snowden has betrayed freedom. In the end, that\u2019s a much greater offense than intentionally acting like an enemy and traitor to his country.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER James Jay Carafano is vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nThis essay is available to McClatchy-Tribune News Service subscribers.

Scott Applewhite\nPRO: His courageous action protected both our privacy and our democracy\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Edward Snowden is a courageous American hero and will be remembered as one long after the \u201cwar on terror\u201d is replaced by some other pretext for violating Americans\u2019 constitutional rights and the rest of the world\u2019s national sovereignty, privacy and, sometimes, security.\n\nHe won his first major legal victory on Dec. 16 when a federal District Court ruled that the NSA\u2019s collection of Americans\u2019 phone records that Snowden first exposed was probably unconstitutional.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that even most of the critical reporting on our national surveillance state still frames the abuses that Snowden revealed as a result of overzealous efforts to protect Americans from terrorism.\n\nEven ignoring the industrial espionage and phone-tapping of foreign leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel or Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff that obviously had nothing to do with terrorism; the surveillance state at home is much more than a violation of our privacy.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: that\u2019s bad enough. Most people don\u2019t want to share the intimate details of their personal lives with government snoops. But the Obama administration has managed to convince some of the more naive among us that the NSA\u2019s big data sweeps just sit in some huge storage facility that are sifted with algorithms to identify or investigate targets that may have something to do with terrorism.\n\nHowever, there is a mountain of evidence that this massive data-gathering is in fact being used against citizens who are involved in constitutionally protected activity, such as political organizing and public education.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has a nice compilation of U.S. law enforcement agencies \u201cspying on American citizens and infiltrating or otherwise obstructing political activist groups\u201d in 36 states in recent years.\n\nFrom spying on anti-war groups like Pittsburgh\u2019s Thomas Merton Center, to infiltrating groups across the country who were planning to protest at the 2004 Republican convention, our government has plenty of additional resources to use the NSA\u2019s data for discouraging and disrupting opposition political activity.\n\nIn 2011, the Boston police, the federally funded Boston Regional Intelligence Center and the FBI were very busy tracking activists who were part of the Occupy movement, Code Pink, and Veterans for Peace.\n\nAs a result they seem to have ignored the intelligence that was literally handed to them about the terrorists who bombed the Boston Marathon in April. This tells you a lot about the priorities of our morally corrupt national surveillance state.\n\n\u201cThese programs were never about terrorism,\u201d wrote Snowden in a letter to Brazilians on Dec. 17, noting they are really about \u201ceconomic spying, social control and diplomatic manipulation. They\u2019re about power.\u201d\n\nBack when Martin Luther King Jr. was inspiring millions in the struggle for civil and voting rights for African-Americans and for economic justice, the FBI was busy tapping his phone and harassing him.\n\nAt one point they tried seriously to blackmail King into committing suicide. Today they would have a constant flow of real-time information not only on his every move and phone call, but on every activist in that movement across the country. That is the difference that technology makes, if we let them get away with it.\n\nThe surveillance state is also making the U.S. into a banana republic, as the burgeoning military-intelligence apparatus becomes more powerful relative to our elected officials, including the President.\n\nIt was the wounded military-intelligence community\u2019s priorities that got the Obama administration to threaten China, Russia and Latin America, and violate all sorts of international laws in a futile attempt to force their co-operation in capturing Snowden. And it is their power that is currently blocking reforms to rein in the NSA\u2019s abuses.\n\nIt\u2019s not just your privacy that is disappearing because of the abuses that Snowden exposed \u2014 it\u2019s the foundations of a democratic society.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Mark Weisbrot is the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.

Should he be considered a traitor?\n\nThe Australian government thinks so. Snowden\u2019s revelation of highly sensitive intelligence operations \u201cdown under\u201d led Australian Federal Attorney-General George Brandis to brand the ex-NSA contractor an \u201cAmerican traitor.\u201d\n\nNo wonder the Aussies were angry. For years they had cooperated covertly with Indonesian intelligence services. Overt cooperation was out of the question, due to Jakarta and Canberra\u2019s longstanding war of words over \u201cBali, boats, and beef\u201d \u2014 the treatment of Aussie tourists, South Asian \u201cboat\u201d people, and cattle exports.\n\nBut behind the curtain, the two democracies had worked out a practical, mutually beneficial information-sharing deal that helped them deal with sensitive issues like refugees and human trafficking. Snowden\u2019s disclosures have now jeopardized this valuable cooperative effort.\n\nIn a strictly legal sense, under U.S. law Snowden might not meet the definition of the word \u201ctraitor.\u201d But the common understanding of the term would certainly apply.\n\nIn disclosing national security secrets, Snowden was following in the footsteps of Julian Assange, the Australian-born founder of WikiLeaks. Both men claim a noble purpose: to use the power of the Internet to expose the corruption and wrong-doing of totalitarian regimes. But in practice, they have told us almost nothing about countries like North Korea, Iran, China, Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nInstead, they\u2019ve mostly spilled secrets from nations ranked at the top of the Freedom House \u201cIndex of Freedom in the World.\u201d These are the countries that organize the peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, combat nuclear proliferation, champion human rights, fight terrorism and human trafficking, and hold free and fair elections. Regardless of their stated intentions, Snowden\u2019s and Assange\u2019s actions have undercut the world\u2019s champions of freedom and given aid and comfort to the world\u2019s totalitarian regimes.\n\nFurther, they have betrayed the idea of freedom. The Assange/Snowden doctrine asserts that complete transparency equals freedom. That\u2019s not just na\u00efve. It\u2019s as pornographic a description of freedom as Auschwitz\u2019s \u201cWork Makes You Free\u201d sign.\n\nRespect for individual privacy is an inherent component of freedom. The government of free peoples is an extension of the people, exercising sovereignty on their behalf. Free societies recognize that keeping legitimate secrets is a legitimate function of government.\n\nDemocracies operate under the concept of \u201cordered liberty.\u201d They establish rules to protect both the individual and the community as whole \u2014 guarding both individual freedom and public safety. No one has the right to discard those rules and substitute rules of his own devising. Flouting ordered liberty doesn\u2019t advance freedom. It creates chaos. And chaos enables evil and kills democracies.\n\nSnowden is neither \u201cfreedom fighter\u201d nor \u201cwhistle-blower.\u201d His leaks are indiscriminate. The vast majority expose no wrongdoing whatsoever.\n\nWhat about those cases where Snowden might argue he has revealed practices that might cross the line?

Federal agencies have inspector generals. Congress routinely investigates such claims. And, yes, we have \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d protection laws. The notion that Snowden had no option but to leak is indefensible.\n\nFinally, Snowden betrayed the trust he was given by the U.S. government to safeguard the nation\u2019s secrets.\n\nFree societies depend on a trustworthy citizenry. If bank tellers, lawyers, doctors, police officials and others in positions of trust were to decide they were, individually, the best arbitrators of what information should or should not be dumped in the public sphere, we wouldn\u2019t be living in Assange\u2019s paradise. We would be living in North Korea, where no one is trusted \u2026 ever.\n\nEdward Snowden has betrayed freedom.

It still treats what our government did as overeager efforts to protect Americans from terrorism.\n\nBut our government's actions obviously had nothing to do with terrorism.\n\nOrdinary Citizens Targeted\n\nOur government has spied on other countries to help give U.S. companies an advantage. It has also spied on the phones of foreign leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. But let's put aside those actions. Even ignoring them, our spy state in the U.S. is doing more than just trespassing into our private lives.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: that\u2019s bad enough.

This widespread gathering of our personal information is in fact being used against ordinary citizens who are simply involved in activities that are protected by our Constitution. Political organizers and public educators have been targeted.\n\nOur government has the ability to use the NSA\u2019s information for the wrong purposes. It can crack down on political groups that don't agree with our government. It has already spied on anti-war groups. It also got inside groups that were planning to protest at the 2004 Republican convention.\n\nIn 2011, the Boston police, Boston Regional Intelligence Center and the FBI were very busy tracking activists. These were not terrorists, but members of protest groups.\n\nAs a result, the law enforcement groups seem to have ignored important intelligence. Information was literally handed to them about the terrorists who bombed the Boston Marathon. This tells you a lot about what's important to our crooked national spy state.\n\nOur Democracy Under Attack\n\nIn the 1960s, Martin Luther King Jr. was inspiring millions in the struggle for rights for African-Americans. At the same time, the FBI was busy spying on his phone and harassing him.\n\nToday it would have a constant flow of information. It would know not only about his every move and phone call, but about every activist in that movement across the country. That is the difference that technology makes and it's important that we don't let our government get away with it.\n\nThe spy state is also making the U.S. into a country run by companies and the military. They're becoming more powerful compared to our elected officials. That includes the president.\n\nAnd it is our military and spies who are trying to block attempts to reduce the NSA\u2019s abuses.\n\nIt\u2019s not just your private life that is being invaded because of the abuses that Snowden exposed \u2014 it's bigger.

Photo: AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite\nPRO: He's exposed the NSA's abuses\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Edward Snowden is a courageous American hero. He will be remembered as one long after the \u201cwar on terror\u201d is replaced by some other excuse for violating Americans\u2019 rights and the rights of the rest of the world.\n\nHe won his first major legal victory on Dec. 16. A judge ruled that the National Security Agency's collection of Americans\u2019 phone records was probably against the Constitution. Snowden was the first person to expose the NSA's snooping into Americans' private lives.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that most of our media's reporting on our national spy state has let us down. It still treats the abuses that Snowden revealed as a result of overeager efforts to protect Americans from terrorism.\n\nBut our government's actions obviously had nothing to do with terrorism.\n\nNot Just Targeting Terrorists\n\nOur government has spied on other countries to help give U.S. companies an advantage. It has tapped the phones of foreign leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. Even ignoring those gross actions, the U.S. is doing much more than just violating our private lives.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: that\u2019s bad enough. Most people don\u2019t want to share all the details of their personal lives with government spies. But the Obama administration has managed to convince some among us that the NSA is just keeping our personal information in storage and not using it. We're led to believe that our information is simply being sorted with computers to identify or investigate targets that have something to do with terrorism.\n\nHowever, there is a mountain of evidence that says the opposite. This massive information-gathering is in fact being used against citizens who are involved in activities that are protected by our Constitution. Political organizers and public educators have been targeted.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has created a list. It shows spying on American citizens and \"obstructing political activist groups\" in recent years. The spying was done by U.S. law enforcement agencies in 36 states.\n\nOur government has the ability to use the NSA\u2019s information to cause problems for political groups that don't agree with our government. It's already spied on anti-war groups. It also got into groups across the country that were planning to protest at the 2004 Republican convention.\n\nIn 2011, the Boston police, the Boston Regional Intelligence Center and the FBI were very busy tracking activists. These activists were not terrorists. They were just members of protest groups.\n\nAs a result, they seem to have ignored the information that was literally handed to them about the terrorists who bombed the Boston Marathon. This tells you a lot about what's important to our crooked national spy state.\n\nA Spy State\n\n\u201cThese programs were never about terrorism,\u201d wrote Snowden in a letter to Brazilians on Dec. 17. He said they are really about \u201ceconomic spying, social control and diplomatic manipulation. They\u2019re about power.\u201d\n\nIn the 1960s, Martin Luther King Jr. was inspiring millions in the struggle for rights for African-Americans, and for the rights of poor people. At the same time, the FBI was busy tapping his phone and harassing him.\n\nAt one point, it tried seriously to blackmail King into committing suicide. Today, it would have a constant flow of information not only on his every move and phone call, but also about every activist in that movement across the country. That is the difference that technology makes, if we let them get away with it.\n\nThe spy state is also making the U.S. into a country run by companies and the military. The expanding military and spy communities are becoming more powerful relative to our elected officials, including the president.\n\nIt was the military-intelligence community that got the Obama administration to threaten China, Russia and Latin America. It was a pointless attempt to force other countries to cooperate in capturing Snowden. In the process, it broke all sorts of international laws.\n\nAnd it is our military-intelligence community\u2019s power that is currently blocking attempts to reduce the NSA\u2019s abuses.\n\nIt\u2019s not just your private life that is being invaded because of the abuses that Snowden exposed \u2014 it's bigger. The foundations of our democratic society are being attacked.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: Mark Weisbrot is the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.\n\nThis essay is available to McClatchy-Tribune News Service subscribers.

Both men claim a noble purpose: to use the power of the Internet to expose the corruption and wrongdoing of brutal, oppressive governments. But in practice, they have told us almost nothing about countries like North Korea, Iran, China, Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nInstead, they\u2019ve mostly spilled secrets from nations ranked at the top of the Freedom House \u201cIndex of Freedom in the World.\u201d These are the countries that organize the peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, combat the spread of nuclear weapons, champion human rights, fight terrorism and human trafficking, and hold free and fair elections.\n\nRegardless of why they say they did it, Snowden\u2019s and Assange\u2019s actions have undercut the world\u2019s champions of freedom. And they've given aid and comfort to the world\u2019s most undemocratic countries.\n\nFurther, they have betrayed the idea of freedom. The Assange/Snowden view of the world asserts that complete transparency equals freedom, which is not just being overly innocent \u2014 it's worse.\n\nIdea Of \"Ordered Liberty\"\n\nRespect for our private lives is a fundamental and essential part of freedom. The government of free peoples is an extension of the people, because the government rules on their behalf. Free societies recognize that keeping some secrets is a necessary role of government.\n\nDemocracies operate under the idea of \u201cordered liberty.\u201d They establish rules to protect both the individual and the community as a whole \u2014 guarding both individual freedom and the safety of citizens. No one has the right to discard those rules and substitute rules of his own choosing. Disregarding ordered liberty doesn\u2019t advance freedom \u2014 it just creates chaos. And chaos enables evil and kills democracies like our own.\n\nSnowden is neither \u201cfreedom fighter\u201d nor \u201cwhistle-blower.\u201d His leaks are broad and all over the place. The vast majority expose no wrongdoing whatsoever.\n\nWhat about those cases where Snowden might argue he has revealed government actions that might cross the line? His actions are still, at best, irresponsible.\n\nThe United States system of ordered liberty offers several ways to raise claims of wrongdoing or abuse of power without endangering our country. Federal agencies have inspector generals. Congress routinely investigates claims of government wrongdoing. And, yes, we have \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d protection laws. The notion that Snowden had no option but to leak secrets is indefensible.\n\nFinally, Snowden betrayed the trust he was given by the U.S. government to safeguard the nation\u2019s secrets.\n\nFree societies depend on trustworthy citizens. Bank tellers, lawyers, doctors, police officials and others in positions of trust can't decide that they as individuals get to choose what information should or should not be dumped in the public. If they did, we wouldn\u2019t be living in Assange\u2019s paradise. We would be living in North Korea, where no one is trusted \u2026 ever.\n\nEdward Snowden has betrayed freedom. In the end, that\u2019s a much greater offense than intentionally acting like an enemy agent and traitor to his country.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER: James Jay Carafano is vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nThis essay is available to McClatchy-Tribune News Service subscribers.

Its conclusion comes from multiple independent sources of data and information.\n\nThe authoritative IPCC study also found that it was \"extremely likely\" that human influence has been the major cause of climate change. Our burning of fossil fuels \u2014 like coal, oil, and gas \u2014 is particularly to blame.\n\nAt the same time, international meetings \u2014 such as the Climate Change Conference just concluded in Warsaw, Poland \u2014 struggle to devise broadly acceptable agreements among countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, the emission of these gases pose grave risks to the world's economy, its environment and public health.\n\nLegislation A Good Start\n\nA major reason for the slow pace of global action is the United States. As the world's leading producer of greenhouse gases on a per-person basis, we simply haven't stepped up to a leadership position.\n\nNor, for that matter, has China, whose surging economy has pushed it to the No. 1 spot in total greenhouse gas emissions. China produces less greenhouse gases per person, but they have more than four times as many people as the U.S. does.\n\nWhat might the United States do to demonstrate that it is prepared to play a leading role in slowing the rate of global climate change? And minimize its effects?\n\nPassing a sweeping national climate change law would be a good start.\n\nThe United States has hardly been standing still on the issue. More than half of the states and more than a thousand U.S. cities have adopted a diversity of policies that could substantially reduce the release of greenhouse gas emissions. They include innovative actions on renewable fuels, such as those made from vegetables. These cities have also been promoting energy efficiency, public transportation, building efficiency and more.\n\nMuch has happened at the federal level too. The Obama administration has invested tens of billions of dollars in cutting-edge research on new renewable energy technologies, such as wind and solar power.\n\nThe administration also brokered historic agreements with the auto industry. Fuel economy standards are set to be raised for cars to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025 and should translate to impressive environmental savings, as cars will burn less gas.\n\nAn Uphill Battle, But Try\n\nEqually important, the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are developing regulations for coal-fired power plants. These promise to begin shifting the nation away from the use of coal to other energy resources that give off far fewer greenhouse gases.\n\nYet the new regulations are not sufficient to tackle climate change, because there is no commitment by the U.S. as a whole. If there was, it might push reluctant nations around the world to do their own part. And some actions, notably the EPA power plant regulations, are certain to be challenged in court by the fossil fuel industry.\n\nNational climate change policy would send a strong signal to the world that the United States takes climate change seriously and it is prepared to step out in front on the issue.\n\nHow likely is it that a highly divided Congress can enact a climate change legislation? It is certainly not likely at present. And it won't happen as long as Republicans continue to deny the existence of climate change and defend the oil industry at all costs.\n\nNonetheless, it is essential that Congress at least try to design and approve a national climate change policy \u2014 and it should do so soon. It needs to draft a law, hold hearings, hear experts and other witnesses, review the evidence, and debate the issue at whatever length is necessary to build support.\n\nCongress should explore all the policy tools it has available to find ways to appeal to Republicans, including incentives that get businesses and corporations involved. Clearly, this will be an uphill battle, but it is necessary to try.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER Michael E.

First, the combination of the natural gas revolution created by fracking and the economic doldrums we are stuck in have already cut our emissions of greenhouse gases dramatically. And that's without Congress doing anything at all.\n\nIf they did jump in, they'd be as likely to screw that up as make things better.\n\nIn addition, we should wait because the current proposals on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are all expensive. Lowering greenhouse gas emissions will be cheaper in the future as technologies improve.\n\nConsider the change in cell phone technology and prices over the past 20 years. When the director of the movie \"Wall Street\" wanted to emphasize Gordon Gecko's power and wealth, he portrayed him holding a brick-size cellphone.\n\nToday, even schoolchildren carry iPhones, which are far more powerful \u2014 and much cheaper. That same innovative process will make both emissions reduction technology and mitigation efforts cheaper and better in the future.\n\nA Pointless Gesture\n\nThe United States alone can do next to nothing about greenhouse gas emissions, and we should not burden our economy to attempt to do so.\n\nChina and India are growing rapidly. The additional greenhouse gasses they produce will swamp any reductions possible in the U.S. today.\n\nFor example, Chinese car ownership today on a per-capita basis is not even equal to U.S. car ownership in 1920.\n\nWhen \u2014 not if \u2014 Chinese consumers close that gap, they'll be driving more than 20 times the number of cars they are driving today. Chinese electricity consumption is similarly growing rapidly too, with new coal-fired power plants opening like clockwork.\n\nIt would be pointless for the U.S. to reduce emissions on its own. And it would handicap negotiators in any effort to reach an agreement with developing economies like China and India.\n\nThose nations will certainly insist on reductions from the developed world as part of the price of any reductions in greenhouse gas emissions they agree to.\n\nWe shouldn't cut our own emissions before an agreement is reached. If we do, we will have to make even more painful cuts to persuade developing countries to sign on.\n\nCareful Consideration, Extended Debate\n\nFinally, this particular Congress is going to be unable to reach agreement on any major legislation before the 2014 elections.\n\nThe leaders of the House and Senate are barely on speaking terms with each other. There's plenty of blame to go around, of course, and neither party is innocent.\n\nA serious approach to climate change is going to require legislation touching on many aspects of Americans' daily lives. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is ultimately going to require substantial changes in our energy consumption.\n\nSince energy touches every aspect of our lives, this is a subject that requires careful consideration and extended debate. We need candidates putting forward specific proposals and debating their merits on the campaign trail. Then voters can make an informed choice about the type of approach they want to see. That hasn't happened yet and debating something this important requires more deliberation than we've had so far.\n\nMoreover, as the members of Congress gear up for the 2014 election cycle, their attention will be on fundraising.\n\nStarting a new debate on such a significant issue at this point in the election cycle is a recipe for really bad legislation. Writing a major bill will touch on virtually every area of the U.S. economy. To suggest writing a major bill in an election year will be inviting every special interest in the country to a party where the taxpayers get to play the role of the pinata.\n\nDeliberation, not speed, is what we need.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER Andrew Morriss holds the D.

It's based on information from many different sources.\n\nGlobal warming can cause changes to our climate and weather. These changes could have a big effect on our lives.\n\nThe study also found that humans are probably the biggest cause of climate change. It happens when when we burn oil, coal, or gas. When we burn those for fuel it makes greenhouse gases. Those greenhouse gases get trapped in the air. And then they heat up the Earth. And that can change our weather.\n\nBut, countries can't agree to lower greenhouse gases. A big climate change meeting just ended in Poland. Not much came out of it. Yet, these gases are dangerous risks to the world's businesses, its environment and people's health.\n\nHave To Start Somewhere\n\nNot much has happened because of the United States. We produce more greenhouse gases than any other country per person. And we haven't stepped up to take the lead on fixing things.\n\nBut China hasn't either. China has been growing quickly and now produces the most greenhouse gases of any country in total.\n\nHow could the United States slow down global climate change and make its effects less serious?\n\nPassing a national climate change law would be a good start.\n\nThe United States has done things to slow climate change. More than half of the states have made laws. More than a thousand U.S. cities have also. The laws include promoting new fuels made from things like vegetables, instead of oil. And they've passed laws so people don't waste energy. And to get more people to take trains instead of cars.\n\nThe Obama government has done a lot too by giving billions of dollars to develop new energy technologies. These new types don't burn oil. Instead, they use sources that don't pollute or run out, such as wind and sun rays.\n\nThe government also got car companies to make new cars that go farther for each gallon of gas they use. That way they will burn less gas.\n\nShowing We're Serious About It\n\nThe government is also making rules that should shift the U.S. away from using coal toward cleaner forms of energy.\n\nYet the new rules are not enough. Our nation needs to pass a big law that affects everyone. Then, other countries might help more.\n\nA national climate change plan would send a strong signal to the world that the United States takes climate change seriously.\n\nBut how can our leaders in Washington pass a climate change law when they can barely get along? It is not likely right now. And it won't happen as long as some of our leaders don't believe in climate change. And some of our leaders are good friends with oil companies which don't want people to stop using oil.\n\nBut, Congress must try to design a national climate change law. And it should do it soon. It needs to hold hearings, listen to experts and review the evidence.\n\nCongress should use all its tools to find ways to appeal to both sides. Clearly, this will be a hard battle.

It doesn't need to. We have already cut by a lot how much greenhouse gas we put out.\n\nAnd that's without Congress doing anything at all.\n\nGreenhouse gases are what makes the planet hotter. But we are releasing less greenhouse gases now because we started using more natural gas. It's cleaner than oil or coal. And since money has been tight and jobs are scarce, people are not driving so much nor shopping a lot. It means cars and factories are burning less fuel.\n\nCongress shouldn't jump in. They could easily mess things up.\n\nCheaper And Better Fixes Later\n\nIt's better to wait. Cutting back on greenhouse gasses is expensive right now. Lowering the amount of greenhouse gases will be cheaper in the future when new technologies are invented.\n\nThink about how much cellphones have changed over time. Cellphones used to be the size of bricks and they were only for the rich. Then the technology improved and prices dropped.\n\nToday, many kids have iPhones. That same type of improvement will happen with greenhouse gases. We'll have new technology soon. It will make fixing climate change cheaper and better in the future.\n\nThe United States can't stop greenhouse gases alone. And it would cost a huge amount of money. We shouldn't pay for it by ourselves. It will hurt U.S. jobs and businesses.\n\nChina and India are growing fast. They're making more greenhouse gasses. Those extra greenhouse gasses would be much more than any cuts we could make now.\n\nFor example, the Chinese own far fewer cars per person than the U.S. They even own fewer than we did per person in 1920.\n\nThe Chinese will drive as much as us someday. When they do, they'll have 20 times the number of cars they have today. That's because they have so many more people than us.\n\nThe Chinese are using a lot more electricity too. New coal power plants are opening there all the time.\n\nNot During An Election Year\n\nCutting greenhouse gases by ourselves is pointless. And it would make it harder to reach an agreement with China and India.\n\nThose countries will definitely ask for cuts from the U.S. and Europe. They won't cut their own greenhouse gases without that.\n\nSo, we shouldn't cut our greenhouse gases. At least not before an agreement is reached. If we do, we will have to make even more cuts to get China and India to sign on.\n\nEnergy affects every part of our lives. So, a law will take careful thought. We need our leaders to put out clear-cut plans. And we need to hear them talk about them in public. Then voters can pick what changes they want to see.\n\nAnd, leaders in Congress are hardly even speaking to each other. It's not likely they will be able to come to an agreement.\n\nSo, Congress won't be able to pass a big law for a while. Also, they're running for elections in 2014. They're going to be busy raising money.\n\nThey shouldn't start talking about a bill right before an election. It could result in a really bad law.\n\nWhat we need is more careful thinking on the matter. We don't need to act fast.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER Andrew Morriss holds the D.

That same innovative process will make both emissions reduction technology and mitigation efforts cheaper and better in the future.\n\nThe United States can do next to nothing about greenhouse gas emissions alone, and we should not burden our economy to attempt to do so.\n\nChina and India are growing so rapidly that their additional greenhouse gas emissions swamp any reductions possible in the U.S. today.\n\nFor example, Chinese car ownership today on a per-capita basis is not even equal to U.S. car ownership in 1920.\n\nWhen \u2014 not if \u2014 Chinese consumers close that gap, they'll be driving more than 20 times the number of cars they are driving today. Chinese electricity consumption is similarly growing rapidly too, with new coal-fired power plants opening like clockwork.\n\nUnilaterally cutting U.S. emissions would be pointless, and would handicap negotiators in any effort to reach an agreement with developing economies like China and India.\n\nThose nations will certainly insist on reductions from the developed world as part of the price of any reductions in greenhouse gas emissions they agree to.\n\nIf we've already unilaterally cut our emissions in advance of an agreement, we will have to make even more painful cuts to persuade developing countries to sign on.\n\nFinally, this particular Congress is going to be unable to reach agreement on any major legislation before the 2014 elections.\n\nThe leaders of the House and Senate are barely on speaking terms with each other. There's plenty of blame to go around, of course, and neither party is innocent.\n\nA serious approach to climate change is going to require legislation touching on many aspects of Americans' daily lives, since reducing greenhouse gas emissions is ultimately going to require substantial changes in our energy consumption.\n\nSince energy touches every aspect of our lives, this is a subject that requires careful consideration and extended debate. We need candidates putting forward specific proposals and debating their merits on the campaign trail so voters can make an informed choice about the type of approach they want to see. That hasn't happened yet and debating something this important requires more deliberation than we've had yet.\n\nMoreover, as the members of Congress gear up for the 2014 election cycle, their attention will be on fundraising.\n\nStarting a new debate on such a significant issue at this point in the election cycle is a recipe for really bad legislation: to suggest writing a major bill that will touch on virtually every sector of the U.S. economy in an election year will be inviting every special interest in the country to a party where the taxpayers get to play the role of the pinata.

Its conclusion is based on several independent sources of information.\n\nThe study also found that it was \"extremely likely\" that human influence has been the major cause of climate change. Our burning of oil, coal, and gas is particularly to blame.\n\nWhen we burn coal, oil or gas, it creates greenhouse gases, which heat up the earth and change our climate.\n\nNeed National Commitment\n\nAt the same time, international meetings have had little luck in getting countries to agree to produce less greenhouse gas. The Climate Change Conference just concluded in Poland but didn't result in any great agreement. Yet, these gases are serious risks for the world's businesses, its environment and public health.\n\nA major reason for the slow pace of global action is the United States, where we produce more greenhouse gases than any other country on a per-person basis. And we simply haven't stepped up to a leadership position.\n\nNor, for that matter, has China, which has been developing quickly and building new cities and factories. That has pushed it to the No. 1 spot in producing greenhouse gas in total. It produces less per person than the U.S., but it has more than four times as many people as the U.S. does.\n\nWhat might the United States do to convincingly show that it is finally prepared to play a leading role in slowing the rate of global climate change?\n\nPassing a full-fledged national climate change law would be a good start.\n\nThe United States has hardly been standing still on the issue. More than half of the states and more than a thousand U.S. cities have have passed a range of policies. These should substantially reduce the release of greenhouse gas emissions. They include new actions on renewable fuels, some of which are made from vegetables, instead of oil. There have also been laws passed to make sure energy isn't wasted, and to promote public transportation.\n\nMuch has happened at the federal level too. The Obama administration has spent tens of billions of dollars on cutting-edge research to develop renewable energy technologies, such as wind or solar power.\n\nSending A Strong Signal\n\nThe administration also reached important agreements with the auto industry. Fuel standards are set to be raised for cars to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. The new standards mean big savings in the use of oil.\n\nEqually important, the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency are developing regulations for coal-fired power plants. These promise to begin shifting the nation away from the use of coal and toward other types of energy that release far fewer greenhouse gases.\n\nYet the new regulations and policy plans are not enough to tackle climate change. They also come with no national political commitment. If there was, it might push reluctant nations around the world to do their own part. And some actions are certain to be challenged in court by the oil industry.\n\nNational climate change policy would send a strong signal to the world. It would show that the United States takes climate change seriously, and that it is prepared to step out in front on the issue.\n\nHow likely is it that a divided Congress can pass climate change legislation? It is not likely at present. And it won't happen as long as Republicans continue to deny the existence of climate change and defend the oil industry at all costs.\n\nNonetheless, it is essential that Congress at least try. It needs to design and approve a national climate change policy, and it should do so soon. It needs to hold hearings, hear experts, review the evidence, and debate the issue at length to build support.\n\nCongress should explore all the tools it has. It must find ways to appeal to Republicans. If it needs to finds ways that make businesses happy, then it should. Clearly, this will be an uphill battle, but it is necessary to try.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER Michael E.

First, our production of greenhouses gases has already fallen on its own. We started using more natural gas thanks to a new method called fracking. Plus, the economy has been stuck for a while which means factories are creating less emissions. And that's without Congress doing anything at all.\n\nIf they did jump in, they'd be as likely to screw that up as make things better.\n\nIn addition, we should wait because the current proposals on how to reduce greenhouse gases are all expensive. Lowering the amount of greenhouse gas produced will be cheaper in the future as technologies improve.\n\nConsider the change in cellphone technology and prices over the past 20 years. Cellphones used to be the size of bricks. Today, even schoolchildren carry iPhones. Those are far more powerful, and much cheaper than old cellphones. That same process of improvement will create new technology to cut greenhouse gases. It will make efforts at fixing climate change cheaper and better in the future.\n\nAct Later, Not Sooner\n\nThe United States can do next to nothing about greenhouse gases on its own. We shouldn't burden American businesses in attempting to do so single-handedly.\n\nChina and India are growing rapidly and the additional greenhouse gases they produce will swamp any cuts possible in the U.S. today.\n\nFor example, Chinese car ownership per person is less than U.S. car ownership was in 1920.\n\nWhen \u2014 not if \u2014 Chinese consumers close that gap, they'll be driving more than 20 times the number of cars they are driving today.

Cutting greenhouse gases is ultimately going to require huge changes in how much energy we use.\n\nEnergy touches every part of our lives. So, this is a subject that requires careful consideration and extended debate. We need candidates putting forward clear-cut proposals and debating their strengths and weaknesses on the campaign trail. Then voters can make a choice about the type of approach they want to see. That hasn't happened yet and debating something this important requires more discussion than we've had so far.\n\nIn addition, the members of Congress are gearing up for their 2014 elections. Their attention will be on fundraising, not passing a good law.\n\nStarting a new debate on such a significant issue right before an election is a recipe for drafting a really bad law. Writing a major bill will touch on nearly every area of the U.S. To suggest it in an election year will be inviting every group in the country \u2014 with their own political and money needs \u2014 to a party.

The IPCC is a group of scientists set up by the United Nations.\n\nThe report was based on information from dozens of experts.\n\nThe study also found that humans have probably been the biggest cause of climate change. Our burning of oil, gas and coal is mostly to blame. When we burn those fuels it creates greenhouse gases that heat up the Earth and change our weather.\n\nBut, countries can't agree to lower greenhouse gases. A big climate change meeting just ended in Poland. Not much came out of it. Yet, these gases are dangerous risks to the world's businesses, its environment and the health of all people.\n\nLeading The Way\n\nA big reason that little has happened is the United States. Per person, we produce more greenhouse gases than any other country. And we haven't stepped up to take the lead.\n\nNeither has China though. It has been growing quickly, building new cities and factories and putting more drivers on the road. That has pushed it to the No. 1 spot in producing greenhouse gases in total. It produces less per person than the U.S., but it has so many more people.\n\nWhat might the United States do to help slow global climate change and make its effects less serious?\n\nPassing a big national climate change law would be a good start.\n\nThe United States hasn't been standing still on climate change. More than half of the states and more than a thousand U.S. cities have made laws. These should reduce greenhouse gases. The laws include actions to promote new fuels, such as those made from vegetables instead of oil. They're also trying to get people to use energy wisely, so it's not wasted. And get more people riding trains instead of cars.\n\nThe Obama government has done a lot, too, by giving billions of dollars to develop new energy technologies that don't burn oil. Wind, and solar energy from the sun, are examples.\n\nThe government also got car companies to make cars that go farther on a gallon of gas so they burn less gasoline. By 2025, cars will have to go 54.5 miles per gallon of gas that they burn.\n\nGet The Ball Rolling\n\nThe White House is also developing rules for coal power plants. These promise to begin shifting the nation away from the use of coal, which is a dirty type of energy.\n\nYet the new rules are not enough to fix climate change. Our whole nation has to pass a law. If it did, that might push other nations around the world to do more.\n\nA national climate change plan would send a strong signal to the world that the United States takes climate change seriously.\n\nBut how likely is it that our leaders in Washington can pass a climate change law when they can barely get along? It is not likely right now. And it won't happen as long as some of our leaders don't believe in climate change. It doesn't help that many of them are friends with the oil companies which make the fuels that cause climate change. Those leaders don't want new laws.\n\nBut, it is necessary that Congress try to design and pass a national climate change law \u2013 and do it soon. It needs to hold hearings, hear experts and other witnesses, review the evidence, and discuss the problem at length to build support.\n\nCongress should explore all its tools so it can find ways to appeal to all our leaders.

And it doesn't need to. We have already cut how much greenhouse gas we make by a lot, and greenhouse gases are what cause climate change.\n\nAnd that's without Congress doing anything at all.\n\nWe cut down on greenhouse gases because we started using more natural gas. It's cleaner than oil, gas, or coal. And since jobs and money have been tight, people are buying less and factories are producing fewer things. This means that less fuels are being burned.\n\nIf Congress did jump in, they could easily mess things up.\n\nWait For New Technology\n\nIt's better to wait. The current plans on how to cut greenhouse gasses are all expensive. Lowering the amount of greenhouse gas released into the air will be cheaper in the future. New technology will help.\n\nThink about how much cellphones have changed over the past 20 years. Cellphones used to be the size of bricks and so expensive that only people in business could use them. But technology has improved and prices have dropped.\n\nToday, even kids carry iPhones. The phones now are far better than the old cellphones. And they are much cheaper. That same type of improvement will happen with new technology to cut greenhouse gases. It will make fixing climate change cheaper and better in the future.\n\nThe United States can do little about greenhouse gases single-handedly. It will cost too much for American businesses to shoulder the expense.\n\nChina and India are growing fast. They're producing more greenhouse gasses. Those extra greenhouse gasses will swamp any cuts we could make today.\n\nFor example, the Chinese own fewer cars per person than the U.S. did in 1920.\n\nBut the Chinese will eventually drive as much as us. When they do, they'll be driving more than 20 times the number of cars they are driving today. That's because they have so many more people than we do.\n\nThe Chinese are using a lot more electricity too. New coal power plants are opening there all the time.\n\nWe Shouldn't Act Alone\n\nIf we cut greenhouse gases by ourselves it would be pointless. And it would make it harder to reach an agreement with developing countries like China and India.\n\nThose nations will definitely ask for cuts from the U.S. and Europe. They won't cut their own greenhouse gases without it.\n\nWe shouldn't cut our greenhouse gases before an agreement is reached. If we do, we will have to make even more cuts to get China and India to sign on.\n\nA serious climate change law will touch on many areas of Americans' daily lives. Cutting greenhouse gasses is going to need huge changes in how we use energy.\n\nEnergy touches every part of our lives. So, a law will take careful thought. We need to discuss it at length. We need our leaders to put out clear-cut plans, and we need to hear them debate them publicly. Then voters can then make a choice about the changes they want to see. That hasn't happened yet.\n\nFinally, leaders in Congress aren't speaking to each other much right now.\n\nSo, Congress won't be able to reach agreement on a big law for a while. Also, they're running for elections in 2014. They're going to be busy running and raising money.\n\nStarting a new debate right before an election could result in a really bad law.\n\nDiscussion, not speed, is what we need.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER Andrew Morriss holds the D.

This money is given by the government to encourage the auto business to make electric cars. The government also offers money to drivers who buy them.\n\nIf that help went away, car companies would lose money on electric vehicles. Electric cars and gas-powered cars are one of the few bright spots for business in the U.S.\n\nThe government support helps companies make up for tough environmental rules the government put in place.\n\nThe rules are a challenge to automakers. Between now and 2025, the distance cars go on a gallon of gas must improve. Now, cars and trucks go on average less than 30 miles per gallon (mpg). They must increase that to more than 50 mpg.\n\nBad Time To Change Direction\n\nAt the same time, more cars that don't burn gas must be sold. In California and nine other states, one out every seven new cars for sale must be electric. Right now just a tiny amount of the cars for sale in those states are electric.\n\nThese rules were made for excellent reasons. The U.S. buys oil from other countries. If things go bad in another part of the world, it could be hard to get oil. If the U.S. buys less oil from other countries, American businesses won't have to worry as much that their oil supply is at risk.\n\nThe rules were also meant to improve the environment by reducing smog and greenhouse gases. These gases are linked to climate change. When we burn things, temperatures increase. That can change nature.\n\nThe rules might be too demanding, but the government won't look at or change them until 2017.\n\nAnd since it takes a long time to launch new types of cars, this is the wrong time to change direction. But, it makes sense that some people would want to end subsidies.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s goal of one million plug-in vehicles in the U.S. by 2015 was too hopeful, and it won't happen in time.\n\nHowever, plug-in vehicles are selling fast. Their sales are growing at a faster speed than traditional hybrids, which run on gas and batteries. The Toyota Prius was the first hybrid which rolled out in 2000.\n\nA Growing Business\n\nWe can learn from the experience of Oslo, Norway. In that European city, many drivers already choose plug-in vehicles over regular gas ones.\n\nIt is true that the first generation of plug-in vehicles do not meet the needs of most Americans. They're too expensive and don't go far before they have to be plugged in to recharge. The Chevrolet Volt, the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla sports car are some of the most popular plug-in cars.\n\nHowever, the four years that plug-ins have been around has paid off. The second generation of plug-in vehicles is about to hit showrooms and every automaker will be offering some form of plug-in vehicle.\n\nCar companies are fighting to build better cars. Each automaker is trying to offer plug-in vehicles that can go far on a charge, recharge quickly, and not cost too much.\n\nThe money the government gives to electric car makers and drivers is important to see if this new technology will work out. Electric cars could be a breakthrough. All U.S. transportation businesses could benefit.\n\nIn the long run, electric vehicles must be sold without government support. They should even be taxed to help pay for keeping roads in good shape. Owners of gasoline-powered vehicles now pay a tax on gasoline.\n\nBut the right time to think about taxes and government support of electric cars is 2017.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER John Graham is dean of the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs and served as administrator of the OMB Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs from 2001 to 2006.

Still, the government is trying by giving money to people who buy electric cars. But it's not money well spent.\n\nWhat we drive says a lot about us.\n\nWhat an electric car says about its owners is that they don\u2019t have children and don't plan to ever have any.\n\nElectric Cars Cost Too Much\n\nElectric cars aren't good for families. They're too expensive, too small, and don't go far enough before they have to be recharged.\n\nChildren are very expensive. The average cost of raising a child for the first 18 years is over $240,000. Add the cost of college to that and each child can easily be more than $340,000.\n\nAt the same time, rich people are less likely to have children than poor people. And well-off people can afford expensive electric cars without needing the money the government awards electric car owners.\n\nElectric cars cost too much, even with government money. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) examines how the government spends money. It says that the lifetime cost of an electric car or plug-in hybrid car is $12,000 more than a gas vehicle or regular hybrid. A hybrid is a car that runs on gas and electric batteries. Some can be plugged in to charge, like an electric car. Regular hybrids can't be plugged in. Their batteries get charged when the car's wheels move.\n\nThe most the government will give you for buying an electric car is $7,500. But that amount would need to be $4,500 more to make up for the difference in cost between an electric car and a regular hybrid.\n\nBut no amount of government action can fix other flaws of electric cars.\n\n\u2014These cars are too small. Space is lost because the batteries they need are so big. They're also made smaller so that they weigh less. Lighter cars can travel for longer before they need to be recharged.\n\n\u2014Most all-electric cars can't go more than 100 miles between charges.\n\n\u2014Charges can take hours and leave a driver dependent on the increasingly unreliable power grid.\n\nElectric-gas hybrid cars run on gas and electric batteries. They are a better alternative, but are still expensive and are small.\n\nNot Practical For Families\n\nHow far electric cars can go without needing to be recharged is important for families. Electric cars are best for drivers with predictable driving patterns. Otherwise they could run out of power at bad times.\n\nBut kids can be all over the place. They may have band, choir, soccer, football or dance practices that change daily. They occasionally get sick and need to be taken home. Sometimes, they get in trouble at school and have to stay late for detention.\n\nThe $7.5 billion the government is spending over the next 10 years promoting electric cars won't result in much. It will just prop up a product that a select group of people will buy.\n\nJ.D. Power surveys people about the things they own. It says that electric car owners see \"environmental friendliness as the most important benefit\u201d of such cars. But even here, electric vehicles fail.\n\nThe Journal of Industrial Ecology published a report that found that manufacturing an electric car puts double the amount of carbon dioxide into the air than building gas cars does. Carbon dioxide is believed to cause climate change, which can hurt the environment. And, the electricity for these cars comes from burning oil and other fuels. Plus, their batteries contain toxic chemicals. Environmental benefits of electric cars are minimal.\n\nIt was 116 years ago that the first electric car went on the market.\n\nElectric cars have been running on empty promises ever since. It\u2019s time for Washington to quit giving away money to people who buy them.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER David A.

The industry needs the support. The subsidies are money given by the government to help the auto industry make electric cars and offer discounts for people to buy them.\n\nIf they went away, car companies would be forced to sell electric vehicles at huge losses of money. The thriving auto industry is one of the few bright spots for business in the U.S. It would be thrown into disarray.\n\nThe subsidies help make up for tough regulations the government put in place.\n\nThose regulations are a huge challenge to automakers. Between now and 2025, the distance cars go on a gallon of gas must improve. New vehicles must increase from less than 30 miles per gallon (mpg) to more than 50 mpg.\n\nAutomakers Need Time\n\nAt the same time, the share of \u201czero emission vehicles\u201d \u2014 which are mostly electric cars that burn no gas \u2014 must rise. In California and nine other states, they make up less than 1 percent of cars. They must increase that to 15 percent of new vehicles being offered.\n\nThese regulations were made for excellent reasons. Reducing the need for the U.S. to buy oil from other countries would make for more stable business conditions. If things go bad in another part of the world it could be hard to get oil.\n\nThe regulations were also meant to improve the environment by reducing smog and greenhouse gases. When cars burn gases it may increase the earth's temperature and cause climate change.\n\nOne can argue that these policies are too demanding or unrealistic. But, they are not scheduled to be looked at again by the federal government until 2017.\n\nTo help with the serious challenge imposed on business, the federal government and the states gave generous subsidies for the new electric vehicle industry to grow. The battery makers, car manufacturers, and electric car buyers all receive help.\n\nAnd since it takes a long time to launch a new electric vehicle industry, this is the wrong time to make any big changes. But, the temptation to do so is understandable.\n\nCritics are right that President Obama\u2019s goal of one million plug-in vehicles by 2015 was too hopeful. It won't happen in time. However, the rate of sales of plug-in vehicles from 2010 to 2013 is growing rapidly.\n\nThe growth rate of plug-in vehicles has already beaten the growth in sales of traditional hybrids, which run on gas and batteries. Sales are even growing faster than those of the Toyota Prius when they were first introduced. The Prius was the first hybrid.\n\nMore Plug-In Cars Coming\n\nIn the next few years, much can be learned from the experience of Oslo, Norway. In that European city, many people are choosing plug-in vehicles over gas-powered ones.\n\nIt is true that the first generation of plug-in vehicles do not meet the needs of most Americans. They're too expensive. The Chevrolet Volt, the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla sports car are some of the most popular plug-in cars.\n\nHowever, the hard work that began four years ago has paid off. The second generation of plug-in vehicles is about to hit vehicle showrooms. Every automaker from Toyota to Volkswagen will be offering some form of plug-in vehicle.\n\nThe industry has entered a healthy phase of competition. Each automaker is trying to offer plug-in vehicles that can go far on a charge, recharge quickly, perform well, and not cost too much.\n\nThe subsidies that now exist are important to see if this promising new technology will work out. Electric cars could prove to be a breakthrough that would help all the auto businesses in the U.S.\n\nIn the long run, the electric vehicle must survive without any government subsidy. Indeed, electric vehicles should someday be taxed to help pay for keeping roads in good shape. Owners of gasoline-powered vehicles now pay a tax on gas.\n\nBut the right time to look at tax policy and subsidies is 2017, when the government plans to reconsider its environmental rules for automobiles.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER John Graham is dean of the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs and served as administrator of the OMB Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs from 2001 to 2006.

Without the subsidies, the auto industry would be forced by unavoidable regulation to sell electric vehicles at huge financial losses. One of the few bright spots in the current American economy, a thriving auto industry, would be thrown into turmoil.\n\nThat regulation presents a huge challenge to automakers: between now and 2025 the average fuel economy of a new car or light truck must increase from less than 30 miles per gallon to more than 50 miles per gallon while the share of \u201czero emission vehicles\u201d \u2014 mostly electrics \u2014 in California and nine other states must rise from less than 1 percent to 15 percent of new vehicle fleets.\n\nThese regulations were adopted with laudable goals: reducing oil dependence, and thereby enhancing the security of the U.S. economy; and improving environmental quality by reducing smog and the greenhouse gases linked to climate change.\n\nOne can argue that these policies are overly stringent or unrealistic but they are not scheduled for reconsideration by the federal government until 2017.\n\nRecognizing the formidable challenge imposed on industry, the federal government and the states enacted generous subsidies for the nascent electric vehicle industry \u2014 the battery suppliers, vehicle manufacturers, recharging companies and consumers.\n\nThat is why, given the long lead times necessary to launch a new electric vehicle industry, this is the wrong time to do a policy U-turn although the temptation is understandable.\n\nCritics argue correctly that President Obama\u2019s national goal of one million plug-in vehicles by 2015 was overly optimistic and will not be accomplished.

People who buy electric cars get money from the government as well.\n\nIt would be a bad idea to \u201cpull the plug\u201d on money to help electric cars.\n\nIf the government stopped helping, car companies would lose money when they sell electric cars. The government made rules so that cars would go further using less fuel. But making new cars costs car makers money, so the government gives car companies money to make the rules easier to handle.\n\nThe rules are a challenge to automakers. Between now and 2025, cars must go longer distances on a gallon of gas. New cars and trucks average less than 30 miles per gallon (mpg) right now. They must increase that to more than 50 mpg.\n\nHelping The Environment\n\nAnd more cars that don't burn gas must be sold. In California and nine other states, one out of every seven new cars will have to be electric. Right now they are just a tiny amount of the cars for sale in those states.\n\nThese rules were made for excellent reasons. The U.S. buys oil from other countries. But things sometimes go bad in those parts of the world, and it could be hard to get oil. If the U.S. buys less oil from other countries, businesses here won't have to worry as much about a steady oil supply.\n\nThe rules are also meant to help the environment. Burning gas might make the earth hotter. That can possibly change the climate.\n\nThe rules may be too demanding. But, the government doesn't plan to look at them again until 2017.\n\nIt takes a long time to launch new types of cars. So, this is the wrong time to change anything. But, the desire to do so makes sense.\n\nPresident Obama wanted there to be one million plug-in cars on the road by 2015. That goal was too hopeful. It won't happen in time.\n\nHowever, sales of plug-in cars are growing quickly. Even faster than traditional hybrids, which run on gas and batteries. Sales are growing faster than the Toyota Prius did at first. It was the first hybrid.\n\nSecond Generation Coming\n\nWe should learn from the city of Oslo in Norway. In that European city, many people choose plug-in cars over cars that use gas.\n\nIt is true that plug-in cars aren't for most Americans. They're too expensive. They don't go very far before they have to be plugged in and charged. The Chevrolet Volt, the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla are some of the most popular plug-in cars.\n\nBut, car makers have learned a lot during the four years that plug-ins have been around. The second generation of plug-in cars is about to come out. Every automaker will be offering a plug-in car.\n\nCar companies are trying to beat each other to get customers. New plug-in vehicles should be able to go farther before they need to be recharged. They should also be cheaper than the older ones.\n\nThe money from the government is important. It will let us see if this new technology will work. Electric cars could be a breakthrough. They could help U.S. business.\n\nSomeday, electric vehicles must be sold without help from the government. People should even pay a little extra for electric cars to keep roads in good shape. Owners of gasoline-powered cars already pay extra to the government when they buy gas.\n\nBut the government should keep supporting electric cars until 2017. Then it can decide if it wants to stop helping them.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER John Graham is dean of the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs and served as administrator of the OMB Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs from 2001 to 2006.

Ford for the christening of the ship at Newport News, Va.

Today\u2019s budget cuts threaten to shrink the Navy\u2019s carrier force \u2014 already reduced from 11 to 10 \u2014 to as few as eight or nine.\n\nYet, aircraft carriers have taken part in almost every U.S. major military operation since World War II. They have served as diplomatic tools to increase or ease political pressure. They have given our military unparalleled freedom of action to respond to a range of requirements. They have supported several missions simultaneously and guaranteed access to any region in the world. And they've reduced the nation\u2019s need to rely on bases in other countries.\n\nIf the U.S. Navy is to continue to secure the high seas, trade routes and shipping lanes around the globe long into the 21st century, it needs a robust fleet \u2014 both in quantity and quality.\n\nThe new Ford-class carriers are an important step toward this goal. The first is the USS Gerald R. Ford. Called by the Navy \u201ctrue \u2018leap ahead\u2019\u201d ships, the Ford-class features important advances to project power over the course of the century it is expected to remain in service.\n\nA Ship For The 21st Century\n\nThe carriers have an advanced aircraft launching system and gear that allows them to quickly stop planes when they land. That will allow them to operate planes heavily loaded with weapons and fuel.\n\nIt also has a new radar system, a larger flight deck and improved elevators for bringing missiles from below the deck to the ship's surface. The Ford-class is more automated than older carriers and easier to maintain. Those improvements will reduce the cost of running the ships.\n\nExperts rightly say that anti-ship missiles can potentially threaten carriers. But, the United States is not the only country investing in building new aircraft carriers.\n\nAs of 2012, about a dozen nations operate carriers. While the size, capabilities and effectiveness of these vessels vary widely, India, China, Brazil and Thailand are all in the aircraft carrier business. That speaks to the ship\u2019s continued usefulness both in peacetime and war.\n\nTrying To Avoid An \"Away Game\"\n\nAs states like China modernize their navies and acquire more advanced capabilities, they threaten America\u2019s long-standing dominance in the ocean.\n\nThis is especially troublesome because despite America\u2019s overall superiority at sea, possible future battles would likely force America to play an \u201caway game.\u201d Nearby enemy forces would enjoy large numerical advantages at first. American forces there would have to make do until the arrival of reinforcements.\n\nThis \u201caway game\u201d issue is especially frustrating because of the growing role that smaller ships are playing in America\u2019s navy. These new ships are more open to attack. An increasing number of smaller ships results in an overall naval balance likely to be less favorable to the U.S. in the future.\n\nA military tilted in America\u2019s favor is the most financially wise use of military power. While Americans hope not to have to fight a military anytime soon, the best way to win any future conflict is not to fight one at all. If we can stay the most powerful military, other countries won't want to fight us. By spending money on new carriers we would be taking steps to achieve this goal.\n\nWhile aircraft carriers are under increased risks due to increasing global capabilities, the solution is not to give up. Rather, the United States needs to make use of new technological advantages.\n\nNew advances in technology could make carriers last longer. New \"directed-energy weapons\" can shoot energy, sound waves, or lasers, instead of missiles. And unmanned planes, called drones, can be used on carriers.\n\nThe key is to do what Americans do best, and that is to create innovative solutions.\n\nThe real question is not whether aircraft carriers are floating relics of the past, but how can the nation not afford to invest in a fleet of new super-carriers?\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER Mackenzie Eaglen is a resident fellow in the Marilyn Ware Center for Security Studies at the American Enterprise Institute.

If it couldn't find a way, it would require automatic spending cuts.\n\nWhen the law was passed, the idea behind it was that the automatic cuts in spending would be unthinkable. Because it was so hard to imagine, people thought this would force a long-term budget deal.\n\nThat thinking proved to be wrong, and the cuts to Pentagon spending began in March 2013. The Pentagon, or Department of Defense, is in charge of military spending and the Air Force, Army, Navy and Marines.\n\nThe problem started because the government has been spending more in a year than it takes in through taxes. That's called a deficit. The law was designed to automatically cut that deficit when spending got out of hand.\n\nHowever, since government spending was going to be cut, at least the Pentagon is losing some money. It already had too much money.\n\nNow we hear whining and complaining from the Pentagon spending lobby \u2014 and especially the Navy, which is pushing for a new line of $14 billion super-carriers \u2014 that America\u2019s national security will be compromised. Of course that depends on how you define \u201cAmerica\u201d and \u201cnational security.\u201d\n\nSpending Unrelated To Security\n\nIf we are talking about the actual security of American citizens and residents \u2014 well, a huge part of Pentagon spending is clearly unrelated to that.\n\nNo one has explained how the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq made us safer. And it cost the lives of more than 4,400 Americans and several hundred thousand Iraqis. It\u2019s tough to see how the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan has increased our security. And then there's the unmanned drone planes that have dropped bombs on civilians in Pakistan, Yemen and other countries. All of these actions are creating new enemies every day.\n\nNo, the Pentagon lobby\u2019s real fear right now is that people will see that Pentagon cuts don\u2019t endanger us in the least, and will want more.\n\nAccording to polls, the public already wants much deeper cuts in Pentagon spending than do our politicians who get money and support from companies that make weapons. These politicians do not have to sacrifice their own sons and daughters for their ambition to expand American power. And they don't suffer consequences when money gets cut.\n\nThe freeze in government spending is called sequestration. It has been in effect since March. A sequestration results in cuts that go into effect automatically if politicians in Washington, D.C., can't agree on how much money the government should spend, and what to spend it on.\n\nEven if it continues through all of next year, the Pentagon budget will only return to the level of 2007 \u2014 excluding wars.\n\nThe Navy plans to spend $2.2 billion this year on the Littoral Combat Ship. And it wants more ballistic missile submarines for as much as $8 billion each.\n\nWeapons Or Preschool Programs?\n\nWould you really rather have these special gifts for companies that sell weapons to the Pentagon? Or would you prefer having thousands of more teachers, or Head Start preschool programs for thousands of children?\n\nAnd these Navy luxury items are small change compared to the hundreds of billions of dollars of Pentagon waste that is planned for the coming decade.\n\nThe worst deal of all would be a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d \u2014 a long-term budget deal to avoid the cuts in Pentagon spending by cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits instead. These programs give money and health care to retired people.\n\nThis is no bargain; it is more like \u201cgrand theft\u201d from our senior citizens: their average Social Security check is about $1,100 a month and makes up most of their income.\n\nSmaller Military Means Less War\n\nIt is often argued that Pentagon spending creates jobs. But, in fact it creates fewer jobs than other forms of government spending or even some tax cuts. If overall spending stays frozen, more cuts in the Pentagon \u2014 and fewer elsewhere \u2014 will provide more jobs for the 11 million unemployed people in our country.\n\nWe narrowly avoided entering the war in Syria in September. Public opposition prevented Congress from voting for it and President Obama from bombing without congressional approval.\n\nA smaller military will mean fewer wars and fewer lives destroyed, as our leaders will be forced to scale back their ambitions. We don\u2019t need a bigger budget for the Navy or the military \u2014 we need a smaller empire, or better yet none at all.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER Mark Weisbrot is the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.

If Congress failed, the law triggered automatic cuts to many government programs.\n\nWhen the law was passed, people believed that big cuts in spending would be unthinkable. The fear of what would happen would force Congress to come up with a long-term deal to fix government spending. Or so people thought.\n\nThat thinking turned out to be wrong. Lawmakers haven't been able to agree on spending, so some government programs aren't getting fully funded.\n\nThe cuts to Pentagon spending began in March 2013. The Pentagon, or Department of Defense, is in charge of military spending and the Air Force, Army, Navy and Marines.\n\nThe problem started because the government has been spending more in a year than it takes in through taxes, creating a deficit. The law was designed to automatically cut that deficit when spending got out of hand.\n\nIt was a dumb idea to reduce the deficit with unemployment being so high. Government spending supports jobs for Americans. However, since government spending was going to be cut, at least the Pentagon is getting less money. It already had too much money.\n\nNaval Spending Just To Prevent Pentagon Cuts\n\nNow we hear whining from the military \u2014 and companies that sell weapons, equipment and services to the military \u2014 that America\u2019s safety will suffer. The Navy is especially concerned because it is pushing for a new line of $14 billion super-carriers. These giant ships will hold lots of planes.\n\nBut a huge part of the money the Pentagon spends doesn't really make us safer.\n\nNo one has explained how the U.S. war in Iraq made us safer. And it cost the lives of more than 4,400 Americans and several hundred thousand Iraqis. It\u2019s tough to see how the war in Afghanistan has increased our safety. And then there's the unmanned drone planes that dropped bombs on people in Pakistan, Yemen and other countries. All of these actions are creating new enemies every day.\n\nNo, the real fear of the military and their suppliers is that people will see that Pentagon cuts don\u2019t put us in danger. If there's no loss of safety, people may want more cuts.\n\nAccording to the polls, the public already wants much deeper cuts in Pentagon spending. It's our leaders in Congress that want to keep the money flowing. They get help and money from companies that sell weapons and supplies. But, these leaders in Congress don't send their own sons and daughters into the wars that they start. And they don't suffer when money gets cut.\n\nSome of the money that the military is supposed to get from the government has been frozen since March. Even if the freeze continues through all of next year, the amount the Pentagon spends will still be as high as it was in 2007 \u2014 not including money spent on wars.\n\nThe Navy plans to spend $2.2 billion this year on a new combat ship. And it wants more submarines that carry missiles which cost as much as $8 billion each.\n\nDo you really want money to go to companies that supply the military? Or would you prefer having thousands of more teachers, or Head Start preschool programs for thousands of children?\n\nAnd these toys that the Navy wants are small change. The Pentagon is planning hundreds of billions of dollars in spending in the next 10 years that will just result in more waste.\n\nGrand Bargain Or Grand Theft?\n\nThe worst deal of all would be a \u201cgrand bargain.\u201d Some leaders in Congress want a long-term spending deal to avoid the cuts to the Pentagon. Instead, they would cut Social Security and Medicare. Those programs provide money and health care to old people in retirement.\n\nThis is no bargain; it is more like \u201cgrand theft\u201d from our senior citizens: their average Social Security check is about $1,100 a month and makes up most of their income.\n\nSome argue that Pentagon spending creates jobs. But, in fact it creates fewer jobs than other forms of government spending. Even some tax cuts would be better than giving the Pentagon more money. If we made more cuts in the Pentagon \u2014 and fewer elsewhere \u2014 we could provide more jobs for the 11 million unemployed people in our country.\n\nWe narrowly avoided entering the war in Syria in September. Public opposition prevented Congress from voting for it and President Obama from bombing without congressional approval.\n\nA smaller military will force our leaders to scale back their ambitions.

They have a long deck that planes can use to take off and land. They cost a lot of money to build.\n\nOver the past 10 years the U.S. has been fighting terrorists and rebels. That type of fighting doesn't need carriers. Because of this, the number of carriers in the Navy has already been reduced from 11 to 10. And the government may cut spending. That could shrink the number to eight or nine.\n\nA Long History Of Carriers\n\nYet, carriers have taken part in almost every big U.S. military action since World War II. They have been used to put pressure on other countries. They have given our military the ability to handle many situations. They have supported several missions at the same time.\n\nCarriers allow us to fight in any region in the world.

And it wants some of that money back to buy new planes and ships. But, it shouldn't be given any more money. It has enough already.\n\nA law passed back in 2011 requires the government to stop giving out money to stop the U.S. from spending more than it takes in.\n\nIt was a dumb idea to lower spending. So many people are out of work. They need help from the government. However, since government spending was going to be cut, the military was a good place to cut. It already had too much money.\n\nNow we hear whining from private companies that sell weapons and equipment to the Pentagon. They say that America will become less safe. The Navy is especially concerned. It wants huge new ships that can hold lots of planes.\n\nMoney Not Keeping Americans Safe\n\nBut a lot of the money spent on the military isn't protecting Americans.\n\nFor instance, how has the U.S. war in Iraq made us safer? And it cost the lives of more than 4,400 Americans. Several hundred thousand Iraqis also died. The war in Afghanistan hasn't increased our safety. And we've bombed Pakistan, Yemen and other countries. All of these actions are making new enemies for us.\n\nThe one's that are scared are the military and companies. They are worried that people will see that the cuts don\u2019t put us in danger. If there's no loss of safety, people may want more cuts.\n\nAccording to surveys, the public already wants bigger cuts in military spending. But our leaders in Congress get support from military companies. So, they want to keep the money flowing. These leaders want to increase American power in the world. But, they don't send their own sons and daughters to war. Nor do they take the hit to their own wallets.\n\nSome military spending has been frozen since March. But, the military is still spending a lot of money.\n\nThe Navy plans to build on a new war ship. And it wants more submarines that can carry missiles.\n\nLess Military, Less War\n\nDo you really want these new weapons? Or would you rather hire thousands of more teachers to help children?\n\nAnd these Navy toys are small change. The military is planning hundreds of billions of dollars in spending in the next 10 years. It will just result in more waste.\n\nThe worst deal of all would be a \u201cgrand bargain.\u201d Some leaders in Congress want a big deal to avoid the cuts in military spending. Instead they would cut Social Security and Medicare. These programs provide money and health care to old people.\n\nThis is no bargain; it is more like \u201cgrand theft\u201d from the elderly: their average Social Security check is about $1,100 a month. It makes up most of the money they get in old age.\n\nIt is often said that Pentagon spending creates jobs. But, there are other ways to find jobs for people.\n\nWe almost got into the war in Syria in September. But, the American people were against it. So, Congress didn't vote for it. President Obama wasn't going to bomb Syria without Congress agreeing to it.\n\nA smaller military will force out leaders to scale back their goals. That will mean fewer wars. Fewer lives will be destroyed. We don\u2019t need more spending by the Navy or the military. We need a country that doesn't send its military all over the world.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT THE WRITER Mark Weisbrot is the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.

Ford for the christening of the ship at Newport News, Va. Photo: AP Photo/Steve Helber\nPRO: America needs more carriers to keep control of the high seas\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A decade of operations against terrorists has created doubts about whether aircraft carriers are necessary. The number of carriers in the Navy has already been reduced from 11 to 10. And cuts in government spending threaten to shrink the number to as few as eight or nine.\n\nAircraft carriers are giant ships that can hold dozens of planes and helicopters. They have long decks that planes can use to take off and land. They cost a lot of money to build and keep in working order.\n\nYet, aircraft carriers have taken part in almost every big U.S. military action since World War II. They have been used to put pressure on other countries. They have given our military the ability to handle different needs. They have supported several missions at the same time. They allow us to fight in any region in the world. And they've reduced the need to rely on bases in other countries.\n\nThe U.S. needs a large fleet of quality carriers. Otherwise, the U.S. Navy may not be able to continue to secure the seas and shipping routes around the globe much longer.\n\n\"Leap Ahead Ships\"\n\nThe new Ford-class carriers are an important step toward this goal. The first is the USS Gerald R. Ford. The Navy calls the carriers \u201ctrue \u2018leap ahead\u2019\u201d ships. The Ford-class has important advances that will allow it to be a powerful ship for a long time. It is expected to be in service for at least the next 90 years.\n\nThe carriers have an advanced aircraft launching system. And they have gear that allows them to slow down planes when they land. That will allow them to operate planes heavily loaded with weapons and fuel.\n\nIt also has a larger flight deck and improved elevators to move missiles from below the deck to its surface. The Ford-class is more automated than older carriers. Fixing the new carriers is easier. That will make it cheaper to run the ships.\n\nIt's true that missiles fired at the carriers could cause damage. But, the United States is not the only country building new aircraft carriers.\n\nKeeping Up With Other Countries\n\nAs of 2012, about a dozen nations use carriers. India, China, Brazil and Thailand are all in the aircraft carrier business. The size, capability and effectiveness of these countries' carriers is different. But, that so many countries are building ships shows that carriers are useful both in peacetime and war.\n\nStates like China are improving their navies and acquiring more advanced capabilities. By doing so, they threaten America\u2019s power in the ocean.\n\nThis is a big worry. The U.S. has had the strongest navy for a long time. But, possible future battles could force America to fight far from home. Enemy forces would have more ships and planes close by. American forces there would have to make do until help could be sent.\n\nThis is a problem because the U.S. has been building smaller ships. These ships are more open to attack. Using more less secure ships results in a weaker navy.\n\nA strong military is worth spending money on. Americans don't want to fight anytime soon.

They're like ray guns. And unmanned planes, called drones, can be used on carriers.\n\nAircraft carriers are not outdated. They're necessary to keep us safe in the future.

A law passed back in 2011 aimed to solve this problem. It said that Congress must agree on how to reduce government overspending. If Congress failed, the law automatically cut the money sent to many government programs, including the military.\n\nWhen the law was passed, people thought there was no way military spending would be cut. They figured Congress would be forced to agree on a deal to stop the overspending.\n\nThis turned out to be wrong. Congress failed to reach a deal. The cuts to military spending began in March 2013.\n\nIt was a dumb idea to try to solve the U.S.'s money problems by cutting spending. Government spending keeps people working. Many people were jobless when the law was passed. However, since government spending was going to be cut, the military was a good place to start. It already had too much money.\n\nNow we hear whining from private companies that sell things to the military. They say that America will become less safe. The Navy is especially concerned because it is pushing for new aircraft carriers. These ships will hold lots of planes.\n\nWar Does Not Make America Safer\n\nBut much of the money the military spends doesn't help protect Americans.\n\nFor instance, how has the U.S. war in Iraq made us safer? And it cost the lives of more than 4,400 Americans and several hundred thousand Iraqis. It\u2019s tough to see how the war in Afghanistan has increased our safety. And we've bombed people in Pakistan, Yemen and other countries. All of these actions are making new enemies for us.\n\nBut the military and companies that sell weapons and equipment are scared. They are worried that people will see that the cuts don\u2019t put us in danger. If there's no loss of safety, people may want more cuts.\n\nAccording to surveys, the public already wants much deeper cuts in Pentagon spending. It's our leaders in Congress who get money from military companies that want to keep the money flowing. These leaders want to increase American power in the world. But, they don't send their own sons and daughters to war. And they don't suffer when money gets cut.\n\nSpending Billions On Military A Waste\n\nSome military spending has been frozen since March. But, the military is still spending plenty of money right now.\n\nThe Navy plans to spend $2.2 billion this year on a new war ship. And it wants more submarines that carry missiles. These cost as much as $8 billion each.\n\nWould you really rather have such gifts made to the military's suppliers? Or would you rather have the money go to pay for thousands of more teachers, or programs that help thousands of poor preschoolers?\n\nAnd these Navy toys are small change compared with the hundreds of billions of dollars in spending the military plans in the next 10 years. It will just result in more waste.\n\nThe worst deal of all would be a \u201cgrand bargain.\u201d Some leaders in Congress want a deal that would prevent cuts in Pentagon spending. Instead, they would cut Social Security and Medicare benefits. These provide money and health care to old people in retirement.\n\nThis is no bargain; it is more like \u201cgrand theft\u201d from older Americans: their average Social Security check is about $1,100 a month and makes up most of the money they get in old age.\n\nIt is often said that Pentagon spending creates jobs. But, in fact it creates fewer jobs than other forms of government spending.\n\nWe almost went to war in Syria in September. But since the American people were against it, Congress didn't vote for it. President Obama wasn't going to bomb Syria without Congress agreeing to it.\n\nA smaller military will force our leaders to scale back their goals. That will mean fewer wars and fewer lives destroyed. We don\u2019t need more spending by the Navy or the military.

Most employees make $7.40 an hour. Photo: Jessica J. Trevino/Detroit Free Press/MCT\nPRO: Higher wages for fast-food workers will fix a broken system\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Walkouts and protests by fast-food workers demanding higher wages and the right to join a union began last November and spread to 60 cities nationwide at the end of August.\n\nThe inspiring movement is led by some of the nation's most underpaid employees, and should be supported by everyone who has a sense of fairness.\n\nFirst, let's dispense with some of the nonsense that people have been told about these workers: they are not mostly teenagers.\n\nThe majority are at least 23 and only 30 percent are teenagers. More than a quarter of them are raising at least one child.\n\nRules Of The Game Changed\n\nHow are they supposed to survive on about $9 an hour - their average wage - with many making the current federal minimum of just $7.25?\n\nObviously, they are not just there for a little while before advancing to higher-paying jobs with benefits. Our terrible economy is not producing enough decent jobs to which they could move. In fact, nearly half of employed college graduates say that their jobs do not require a college degree.\n\nFast-food workers are suffering for the same reasons that the majority of employees have lost ground for decades: the rules of the economy have been rewritten against them.\n\nThe richest 1 percent of Americans have doubled their share of America's total income from 1980 to 2011. They didn't double their slice of the pie because of changes in technology or because they had the most needed skills.\n\nThey did it because the link between how much a person produces and how much he or she takes home has been broken. If the federal minimum wage had increased since 1968 the way it did in prior decades, it would be $17 per hour today. Not a meager $7.25.\n\nRepairing A Broken Link\n\nThe broken link between productivity and wages is due to the fact that most workers have lost bargaining power. That is a result of intentional \"reforms,\" including:\n\nThe weakening of labor unions through changes in and non-enforcement of labor law;\n\nInternational \"trade\" agreements that put blue-collar workers but not professionals into serious competition with cheaper labor overseas;\n\nAnd many other policy changes that redistribute income up towards the rich.\n\nThese changes to our structure causes an economy that has depended more and more on consumer indebtedness and bubble-driven growth -- especially the huge stock market bubble of the late '90s and the real estate bubble that followed after 2002. The collapse of the real estate bubble, which caused the Great Recession and the weak recovery since mid-2009, has further undermined workers' bargaining power.\n\nA Call For Action\n\nThe organization and united action of fast-food workers is another sign that this economic experiment of nearly 40 years has run its course. This kind of mass organizing around domestic economic issues has not been seen for a long time, perhaps since the Great Depression.\n\nPresident Obama supports a higher minimum-wage. Unfortunately, he didn't deliver on his campaign promise to push for the Employee Free Choice Act, which would have gone a long way to restore workers' rights to form unions and ask for higher pay.\n\nObama and his allies were just defeated in their efforts to drag the country into another military conflict, because Americans showed the Congress that they were sick and tired of senseless wars, and those who voted for another one would be held accountable. Maybe we should make these politicians understand that we are also sick and tired of an economy that delivers the goods to fewer and richer people each year, and leaves tens of millions of people struggling to get by. Then we might begin to reverse some of the wrongs here at home, too.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER Mark Weisbrot is the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.

Far from improving their condition, it left them worse off. Raising the wages of fast-food workers to $15 an hour would produce similar results for those the proposal is intended to help.\n\nIn America, minimum-wage workers are better paid than the average worker in Mexico. Why? It's not because U.S. employers are more generous than their Mexican counterparts. Nor do Americans somehow deserve better pay.\n\nAmerican minimum-wage earners make more because they produce more. Better education and better-funded companies allow American workers to be more productive, raising their earnings.\n\nCompetition forces businesses to pay workers according to their productivity. If companies pay less, their employees will jump ship to competitors. And if they pay workers more than they produce, they go out of business.\n\nMore Pay Equals Less Jobs\n\nFor better or worse, fast-food jobs are relatively low-productivity positions, typically filled by inexperienced workers. Most fast-food customers want a quick, inexpensive meal. They will not regularly pay premium prices for a burger and fries.\n\nDoubling McDonalds' wages would raise its total costs by 25 percent, meaning the company would not make any profits on its sales. But raising prices would drive customers away.\n\nIf Congress forced fast-food restaurants to pay $15 an hour, they would have to get a lot more productive to justify those higher costs. That would mean replacing current workers with machines and hiring fewer, more skilled workers to maintain them.\n\nRestaurants could do this in a variety of ways, such as using iPad stations instead of cashiers to take orders, or installing the new robotic burger flipper that makes up to 400 hamburgers an hour.\n\nAt current wages these costly, high-tech improvements make sense for only a few restaurants. However, if wages doubled, it would be worth it to make the investment in iPads and robots. They would become widespread, resulting in fewer jobs in the fast-food industry and higher pay for those who remain.\n\nDon't Super-Size Wages\n\nThose who consider such a trade-off worthwhile miss the economic role of minimum-wage jobs. For most workers, they are entry-level positions where they can gain experience that makes them more productive and helps them command higher pay in their next job.\n\nBusinesses value skills like reliability, discipline and the ability to accept instructions. Fast-food jobs help inexperienced workers build up these basic skills.\n\nMost Americans started out in a job paying within a dollar of the minimum wage. Few stay there long. The average fast-food employee stays at his or her restaurant for less than a year. These are simply gateway jobs, the first step on a career ladder. That is why the vast majority of fast-food workers are under the age of 25.\n\nSuper-sizing fast-food wages would eliminate many of these entry-level positions, making it harder for young people to land that all-important first job and start climbing the ladder of success.\n\nMost lawmakers and leaders recognize this. Not even the most liberal state has a minimum wage anywhere near $15 an hour.\n\nAn Economy Torched By Higher Pay\n\nAmerican Samoa is an example of would happen if the supporters of the \"living wage\" movement prevail.\n\nThe island territory used to have a separate minimum wage because of its lower incomes. However, in 2007 Congress applied the U.S. minimum wage to Samoa. For the tiny Pacific Ocean nation this was the economic equivalent of $20 an hour.\n\nIt did not boost purchasing power, increase the demand for goods and services or improve the way people live. Instead, unemployment septupled to more than 35 percent.\n\nThe Samoan economy collapsed. The islands' governor begged Congress to suspend the wage hikes, pleading: \"Our job market is being torched. Our businesses are being depressed. Our hope for growth has been driven away. How much does our government expect us to suffer?\"\n\nEconomics are not like laws that can be repealed, no matter how good intentions are. Requiring dramatically higher fast-food wages would eliminate hundreds of thousands of entry-level jobs. This would no more help fast-food workers than bleeding them with leeches.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER James Sherk is a senior policy analyst in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation.

Anyone who cares about fairness should support them.\n\nFirst, let's throw out some of the nonsense that people say about these workers. They are not mostly teenagers working for pocket money.\n\nMost of them are at least 23 years old and more than a quarter of them are raising at least one child.\n\nNot Enough Jobs\n\nHow are they supposed to survive on about $9 an hour, which is their average wage? The lowest amount you can be paid, the minimum wage, is $7.25 an hour. Many only make that.\n\nClearly, they are not just working at these jobs for a short time and then moving on to higher pay. In America, there are a lot of jobs for low-skilled workers. There are jobs for people who went to college. There are not enough jobs for people in between.\n\nFast-food workers are suffering for the same reasons that most workers are. They have been making less and less money over the years. The government wrote the rules of how companies can work. They wrote them in a way to help businesses make more money. But the rules do not pay attention to the workers.\n\nThe very richest Americans are making much more money than they did 30 years ago. They are not getting richer because of changes in technology or because they have the most needed skills.\n\nThey are making more money because the rules have changed. If pay had gone up since 1968 the way it did for many years before then, the lowest wage someone could take home would be $17 an hour today, not a measly $7.25.\n\nTime For A Change\n\nPeople are not getting paid as much because of what were called government \"reforms.\" Some of the changes made it easier for companies to make their goods overseas. In some of these other countries, people will work for less money.\n\nThese reforms made our country less stable financially. Now, these fast-food workers are telling us that it is time for a change.\n\nThis kind of mass protest around national economic issues has not been seen for a long time.

But the strange treatment only made the sick sicker.\n\nToday, people are trying to help fast-food workers. They want to raise their wages to $15 an hour. The problem is, it will only hurt them.\n\nIn America, minimum-wage workers get paid more than workers in Mexico. Why? It's not because U.S. companies are more generous than Mexican companies. Nor do Americans somehow deserve better pay.\n\nAmerican minimum-wage workers earn more because they produce more. They are able to produce more because they are better educated. Also, the companies they work for have more money available to buy better equipment. These two facts put together mean American workers can get more done and earn more for their work.\n\nPaid What You're Worth\n\nBusinesses have to pay productive workers well. If companies pay less, those productive workers will just jump ship and go work for another company. That's what competition is all about. However, if they pay workers more than they produce, companies will just go out of business.\n\nThe fact is, fast-food jobs are relatively low-productivity jobs. The work is usually done by inexperienced workers. Most fast-food customers want a quick, cheap meal. They will not pay top prices for a burger and fries, at least not all the time.\n\nDoubling McDonalds' wages would raise its total costs by one-quarter. If it kept prices steady, the company would not make any profits on its sales. But raising prices would drive customers away.\n\nIf Congress forced fast-food restaurants to pay $15 an hour, they would have to get a lot more productive to offset those higher costs. That would mean replacing current workers with machines.\n\nThe technology is ready. Customers could use self-serve iPad stations to enter their orders. There's a robotic burger flipper that makes up to 400 hamburgers an hour. Restaurants could install one to replace several workers at once.\n\nThese high-tech improvements are costly, but they would make sense for restaurants to buy them if wages doubled. The end result: far fewer jobs for humans in the fast-food industry.\n\nThose who think such a trade-off is worthwhile miss the point of minimum-wage jobs. For most workers, they are entry-level positions. Starter jobs like these are where they can gain experience that makes them more productive and helps them get better pay in their next job.\n\nBusinesses look for skills like reliability, self-control and the ability to follow instructions. Fast-food jobs train new workers in these basic skills.\n\nStarter Jobs Would Disappear\n\nMost Americans started out earning near minimum wage at their first job. Few stay there long. The average fast-food employee stays at his or her restaurant for less than a year. This is the first step on a career ladder. That is why most fast-food workers are under the age of 25.\n\nSuper-sizing fast-food wages would make many of these starter jobs disappear. Young people would have a hard time getting on to the ladder of success.\n\nMost lawmakers and leaders understand this. No state has a minimum wage anywhere near $15 an hour. But American Samoa is an example of would happen if the supporters of the $15 an hour plan get their way.\n\nThe island territory of American Samoa used to have a separate minimum wage because of its lower incomes. However, in 2007 Congress told American Samoa it must follow the U.S. minimum wage. For the tiny Pacific Ocean nation this was equal to $20 an hour.\n\nIt did not boost people's ability to buy more goods. It didn't increase the demand for goods and services. Nor did it improve the way people live. Instead, unemployment skyrocketed, leaving more than 35 percent of the islanders jobless.\n\nBusiness growth and spending in American Samoa collapsed. The islands' governor begged Congress to stop the wage hikes, pleading: \"Our job market is being torched. Our businesses are being depressed. Our hope for growth has been driven away. How much does our government expect us to suffer?\"\n\nWhen it comes to money, you can't interfere with the balance between what things cost and what people will pay for them. That balance isn't like some government law you can just undo. There will be unwanted results, even if you mean to do good. Boosting fast-food wages would make thousands of starter jobs disappear. Just like leeches didn't help sick patients in the Middle Ages, this plan won't help today's fast-food workers.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER James Sherk is a senior policy analyst in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation.

Trevino/Detroit Free Press/MCT\nPRO: Restaurant workers fighting for the vast underpaid majority\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Walkouts and protests by fast-food workers demanding higher wages and collective bargaining rights began last November and spread to 60 cities nationwide at the end of August.\n\nIt is an inspiring grass-roots movement led by some of the nation's most underpaid employees, and should be supported by everyone who has a sense of fairness.\n\nFirst let's dispense with some of the nonsense that people have been told about these workers: they are not mostly teenagers.\n\nAs my colleagues John Schmitt and Janelle Jones have shown, the majority are at least 23 and only 30 percent are teenagers. More than a quarter of them are raising at least one child.\n\nHow are they supposed to survive on about $9 an hour - their average wage - with many making the current federal minimum of just $7.25?\n\nObviously, they are not just there temporarily before advancing to higher-paying jobs with benefits: our deformed economy is not producing enough decent jobs to which they could move. In fact, nearly half of employed college graduates say that their jobs do not require a college degree.\n\nFast-food workers are suffering for the same reasons that the majority of employees have lost ground for decades: the rules of the economy have been rewritten against them.\n\nIt is not primarily \"technological change\" or \"skills mismatches\" that have caused the richest 1 percent of Americans to double their share of total income from 10 percent in 1980 to 20 percent in 2011. It is because the link between productivity growth - increasing output per employee \u2013 and wage growth has been broken. If even the federal minimum wage had increased with productivity and inflation since 1968 \u2013 as it had done in prior decades \u2013 it would be $17 per hour today instead of a meager $7.25.\n\nThe broken link between productivity and wages is due to the fact that most workers have lost bargaining power. And that is a result of deliberate \"reforms,\" including:\n\nThe weakening of labor unions through changes in and non-enforcement of labor law;\n\nInternational \"trade\" agreements that put most workers but not higher-paid professionals into more serious competition with lower-wage labor abroad;\n\nAnd many other policy changes that redistribute income upward.\n\nThe result of these structural changes is an economy that has depended increasingly on consumer indebtedness and bubble-driven growth _ especially the huge stock market bubble of late '90s and the real estate bubble that followed after 2002. The collapse of the real estate bubble, which caused the Great Recession and the weak recovery since mid-2009, has further undermined workers' bargaining power.\n\nThe organization and collective action of fast-food workers, like that of the \"Occupy Wall Street\" movement, is another indication that the right-wing and neoliberal economic experiment of nearly 40 years has run its course. This kind of mass organizing around domestic economic issues has not been seen for a long time, perhaps since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nPresident Obama supports a higher minimum-wage but unfortunately didn't deliver on his campaign promise to push for the Employee Free Choice Act, which would go a long way to restoring workers' rights to form unions and bargain collectively.\n\nObama and his allies were just defeated in their efforts to drag the country into another military conflict, because Americans showed the Congress that they were sick and tired of senseless wars, and those who voted for another one would be held accountable. Maybe we should make these politicians understand that we are also sick and tired of an economy that delivers the goods to fewer and richer people each year, and leaves tens of millions of people struggling to get by. Then we might begin to reverse some of the wrongs here at home too.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER Mark Weisbrot is the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.

Far from improving their condition, it left them worse off. Raising the wages of fast-food workers to $15 an hour would produce similar results for those the proposal is intended to help.\n\nIn America, minimum-wage workers are better paid than the average worker in Mexico. Why? It's not because U.S. employers are more generous than their Mexican counterparts. Nor do Americans somehow deserve better pay.\n\nAmerican minimum-wage earners make more because they produce more. Better education and greater capital investment make American workers more productive, raising their earnings.\n\nCompetition forces businesses to pay workers according to their productivity. If companies pay less, their employees will jump ship to competitors. And if they pay workers more than they produce, they go out of business.\n\nFor better or worse, fast-food jobs are relatively low-productivity positions, typically filled by inexperienced workers. Most fast-food customers want a quick, inexpensive meal. They will not regularly pay premium prices for a burger and fries.\n\nDoubling McDonalds' wages would raise their total costs by 25 percent _ well above profit margins. But raising prices would drive customers away.\n\nIf Congress mandated fast-food restaurants to pay $15 an hour, they would have to change operations to deliver the kind of productivity to justify those higher costs. That would mean replacing current workers with machines and hiring fewer, more skilled workers to maintain them.\n\nRestaurants could do this in a variety of ways, such as using iPad kiosks instead of cashiers to take orders, or installing the new robotic burger flipper that makes up to 400 hamburgers an hour.\n\nAt current wages these high-tech investments make sense for only a few restaurants; if wages doubled they would become widespread. The end result: far fewer jobs in the fast-food industry and higher pay for those who remain.\n\nThose who consider such a trade-off worthwhile miss the economic role of minimum-wage jobs. For most workers, they are entry-level positions where they can gain experience that makes them more productive and helps them command higher pay in their next job.\n\nBusinesses value skills like reliability, discipline and the ability to accept instructions. Fast-food jobs instill these basic skills in inexperienced workers.\n\nMost Americans started out in a job paying within a dollar of the minimum wage. Few stay there long. The average fast-food employee stays at his or her restaurant for less than a year. These are simply gateway jobs, the first step on a career ladder. That is why the vast majority of fast-food workers are under the age of 25.\n\nSuper-sizing fast-food wages would eliminate many of these entry-level positions, making it harder for young people to land that all-important first job and start climbing the ladder of success.\n\nMost policymakers recognize this. Not even the most liberal state has a minimum wage anywhere near $15 an hour. But American Samoa offers a case study of would happen if the \"living wage\" lobby prevailed.\n\nThe island territory used to have a separate minimum wage because of its lower incomes. However, in 2007, Congress applied the U.S. minimum wage to Samoa. For the tiny Pacific Ocean nation this was the economic equivalent of $20 an hour.\n\nIt did not boost purchasing power, stimulate demand or raise living standards. Instead unemployment septupled to more than 35 percent.\n\nThe Samoan economy collapsed. The islands' governor begged Congress to suspend the wage hikes, pleading: \"Our job market is being torched. Our businesses are being depressed. Our hope for growth has been driven away ... How much does our government expect us to suffer?\"\n\nGood intentions do not repeal the laws of economics. Requiring dramatically higher fast-food wages would eliminate hundreds of thousands of entry level jobs. This would no more help fast food workers than bleeding them with leeches.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER James Sherk is a senior policy analyst in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation.

Their cause should be supported by everyone who has a sense of fairness.\n\nFirst, let's throw out some of the nonsense that people have been told about these workers. Despite what some people think, they are not mostly teenagers.\n\nThe majority of them are at least 23 years old. Only three in 10 are teenagers. More than a quarter of them are raising at least one child.\n\nLack Of Good-Paying Jobs\n\nHow are they supposed to survive on about $9 an hour, which is the average wage? The lowest amount you can be paid, or the minimum wage, is $7.25 an hour. Many of the workers make that.\n\nClearly, they are not just working at these jobs for a short time and then moving on to great careers. Our unstable economy does not have enough good jobs for them. In fact, nearly half of employed college graduates say their jobs do not need a college degree.\n\nFast-food workers are suffering for the same reasons that the majority of employees have lost ground for decades: the rules of the economy have been rewritten against them.\n\nThe richest 1 percent of Americans have doubled their share of America's total income from 1980 to 2011.\n\nThey didn't double their slice of the pie because of changes in technology or because they had the most needed skills.\n\nThey did it because the link between how much a person produces and how much he or she takes home has been broken. If wages had increased since 1968 the way they did in past decades, the lowest wage someone could take home would be $17 per hour today. Not a measly $7.25.\n\n\"Reforms\" Hurt Workers\n\nWhy are wages no longer tied to productivity? It's because most workers have lost the power to bargain with their employers. And that is a result of so-called \"reforms\" the government made on purpose, including:\n\nChanges to labor law. Failure to enforce existing laws. Both made unions weaker;\n\nTrade agreements that put American workers into competition with cheaper labor overseas;\n\nAnd many other law changes that take money from the poor and give it to the rich.\n\nThese changes have left the country in a weakened state. Jobs are still scarce. Workers have even less power than before.\n\nThe protests by fast-food workers is another sign that it is time to end the 40-year-old experiment on the American worker. This kind of mass protest around wage and work issues has not been seen for a long time, perhaps since the Great Depression.\n\nPresident Obama supports a higher minimum wage. Unfortunately, he didn't keep his promise to push for the Employee Free Choice Act. The act would have gone a long way to give workers the rights to form unions and ask for higher pay.\n\nObama and his allies just tried to drag the country into another war. They failed, because Americans showed the Congress that they were sick and tired of senseless wars. They showed lawmakers that whoever voted for another war would be held accountable. Maybe we should make these politicians understand that we are also sick and tired of a system that delivers the goods to fewer and richer people each year, and leaves tens of millions of people struggling to get by.
